# Pytra Transpiler Specification: `@extern` / `@abi` and Fixed ABI Types (C++ Backend)

Notes:

- `@extern` is a canonical feature of the current implementation.
- `@abi` is an approved next-step extension; this document defines its target design.
- Before `@abi` is implemented, generated runtime helpers follow the ordinary internal-representation rules.
- For `@abi`, this document is the source of truth for syntax, semantics, modes, and responsibility separation from `@extern`. The parser/EAST metadata format is fixed separately by `P1-RUNTIME-ABI-DECORATOR-01-S1-02`.

## 1. Objective

Pytra is a transpiler from Python into C++ and other target languages. Inside the C++ backend, ownership forms such as `rc<T>` are used to manage object lifetime.

Because of optimization during translation, the same Python type may map to multiple internal C++ representations. For example:

- `rc<list<rc<bytearray>>>` -> `list<rc<bytearray>>`
- `list<rc<bytearray>>` -> `list<bytearray>`

This drift becomes a problem at two kinds of boundaries:

- `@extern` functions, whose implementation is delegated to externally defined C++ code
- generated/runtime helpers that should use a fixed ABI shape instead of the backend's internal representation

`@extern` functions must always be callable with the same boundary types regardless of the internal representation at the call site. Likewise, some generated helpers, such as `str.join`, need a fixed value ABI.

This specification solves the problem by separating:

- `@extern` as an external-implementation marker
- `@abi` as a generated/helper boundary ABI override

and assigning each of them a **fixed ABI type**, while inserting **ABI adaptation** at call sites only when needed.

Important:

- `rc<T>` is an internal ownership form of the C++ backend, not the ABI itself.
- Value/container ABI types such as `str`, `bytes`, `bytearray`, `list[T]`, `dict[K,V]`, `set[T]`, and `tuple[...]` must **not expose `rc<>`**.
- `rc<>` is allowed in the ABI only for types whose reference semantics are essential, such as user classes.
- The backend may still use typed handles such as `rc<list<T>>` for internal optimization and alias preservation, but these are **internal types**, not ABI types.
- In particular, even when `rc<list<T>>` is used to preserve aliases under `cpp_list_model=pyobj`, the `@extern` boundary must normalize it to `list<T>`.

This specification supports only **argument-less `@extern`**.  
`@abi` does not replace `@extern`; it is an orthogonal helper annotation.

## 2. Terms

- **Internal Type**  
  The actual C++ representation type used during optimization and lowering. Multiple patterns may exist after optimization.
  Examples: `list<bytearray>`, `rc<list<bytearray>>`, `object`

- **ABI Type**  
  The fixed C++ type used at an `@extern` or `@abi` boundary. It must match the function signature defined on the runtime/target-language side.

- **ABI Adaptation**  
  The conversion inserted at a call site from the internal type to the ABI type. It is inserted only when necessary, including no-op adaptation.

- **Value ABI**  
  Boundary types that do not contain `rc<>`, such as `str`, `bytes`, `bytearray`, `list[T]`, `dict[K,V]`, `set[T]`, and `tuple[...]`.

- **Reference ABI**  
  Boundary types that preserve identity or dynamic dispatch, such as user classes and `object`.

## 3. Basic `@extern` Specification

### 3.1 Syntax

Only the following Python-side form is allowed.

```python
@extern
def write_png(image: list[bytearray]) -> None: ...
```

```python
from pytra.std import extern

@extern
def write_png(image: list[bytearray]) -> None: ...
```

`extern` is only a marker and behaves as a no-op at Python runtime.

```python
def extern(fn):
    return fn
```

- Argumented forms such as `@extern(...)` are not supported.
- An extern marker on a variable uses `name = extern(expr)`.
- `name: Any = extern()` declares an ambient global with the same symbol name.
- `name: Any = extern("symbol")` declares an ambient global under a different symbol name.
- `name: T = extern(expr)` keeps the existing host-fallback / runtime-hook initializer behavior.
- Ambient-global variable declarations are allowed only on the JS/TS backends in v1 and must be compile errors on other backends.
- runtime-SoT `@extern` is declaration-only metadata and does not identify the target implementation owner.
- runtime layout / manifest / runtime symbol index define the native implementation owner.
- ambient-global `extern()` / `extern("symbol")` is a separate category from runtime `@extern`.

### 3.2 Meaning

A function annotated with `@extern` is lowered into a call to a function provided by the target language, here C++.

For an `@extern` function, Pytra determines:

- the external symbol name
- the ABI type

Even if actual arguments are represented with internal types at the call site, the transpiler adapts them to the ABI types before calling the external function.

For Python-runtime compatibility, an `@extern` function may still have a Python-executable body, for example `return __m.sin(x)`. The transpiler never adopts that body as the target implementation; it lowers the function into an external-symbol call instead.

Variable `extern(...)` forms are handled separately from function `@extern`.

- `extern(expr)` keeps `expr` as the Python-runtime fallback / host-only initializer.
- `extern()` declares an ambient global under the same variable name, without a Python fallback.
- `extern("symbol")` declares an ambient global under the given symbol name, without a Python fallback.

JS/TS lower ambient-global variable declarations as import-free symbols and allow raw property access / method call / call-expression lowering only for bindings explicitly marked as ambient globals, not as a general `Any/object` relaxation.

runtime-SoT `@extern` stays declaration-only metadata.

- `extern_contract_v1` / `extern_v1` describe only the declared symbol shape and must not encode native ownership.
- runtime layout / manifest / runtime symbol index determine the native implementation owner.
- ambient-global `extern()` / `extern("symbol")` is separate from runtime-SoT `@extern` and must not participate in owner resolution.

### 3.3 Host-Only Import Rule (`as __name`)

Imports such as `import ... as __m` are treated as host-only imports.

- A host-only import is used only to support Python execution, such as evaluating the Python body of an `@extern` function.
- It is not emitted into target-language code.
- References to the host-only alias are allowed only inside an `@extern` function body or an `extern(expr)` initializer.
- Using `__m` anywhere else is a compile error.
- `_name` with a single leading underscore is not host-only and is treated as a normal import.

### 3.4 Basic `@abi` Specification (Approved Extension)

#### 3.4.1 Objective

`@abi` is used when the boundary signature of a generated/runtime helper must be fixed.

Its purpose is different from `@extern`.

- `@extern`
  - fixes the implementation location to "external implementation"
- `@abi`
  - fixes only the boundary ABI shape, regardless of whether the implementation is generated or external

Therefore `@abi` must not absorb `@extern` by introducing forms such as `no_body` or `external`.

#### 3.4.2 Syntax

```python
from pytra.std import abi

@abi(args={"parts": "value"}, ret="value")
def py_join(sep: str, parts: list[str]) -> str:
    ...
```

In the initial scope, only the following form is supported:

- keyword arguments only
- `args={param_name: mode}`
- `ret=mode`

Unsupported:

- positional forms such as `@abi("value")`
- application to classes, methods, lambdas, or nested functions
- general exposure to all user programs

The initial target may be limited to top-level helpers in runtime SoT modules (`src/pytra/built_in/*.py`, and `std/utils` if needed).

At Python runtime, `abi` behaves as a no-op decorator.

```python
def abi(*, args=None, ret="default"):
    def deco(fn):
        return fn
    return deco
```

#### 3.4.2.1 Initial Acceptance Conditions

In the initial rollout, the parser/validator may accept only forms that satisfy all of the following:

- applied to a top-level function
- keyword-only `@abi(args=..., ret=...)`
- keys in `args` match real parameter names
- canonical modes are one of `default`, `value`, or `value_mut`
- allowed canonical return modes are only `default` or `value`
- the source surface may accept `value_readonly` as a temporary alias, but canonical metadata must normalize it to `value`

The following are all compile errors:

- unknown modes
- ABI overrides for undeclared parameter names
- positional forms such as `@abi("value")`
- application to methods, classes, lambdas, or nested functions
- early use in ordinary user code outside runtime helpers

#### 3.4.3 Meaning of `@abi`

`@abi` does not act on the whole function at once. It acts **per parameter** and **per return value**.

Reasons:

- immutable parameters such as `str` do not need an override
- only mutable containers such as `list[str]` may need a fixed value ABI
- some cases need a different policy only for the return value

Therefore the canonical per-parameter form is:

```python
@abi(args={"parts": "value"}, ret="value")
```

#### 3.4.4 Initial Modes

The initial rollout defines the following three modes:

- `default`
  - no override
  - follow the existing internal representation / backend default policy
- `value`
  - fix the return value, or a parameter, to the canonical value ABI
  - in parameter position, this means a read-only value ABI
  - the callee must not mutate this argument destructively
- `value_mut`
  - fix a parameter to a writable value ABI
  - explicitly marks rare mutable value-helper boundaries

Notes:

- `value` is especially important for C++ `list/dict/set/bytearray`.
- It means "do not accept `rc<>` at the ABI boundary", not "always copy".
- The C++ backend may use declaration forms such as `const list<T>&` or `const dict<K,V>&`, and may borrow read-only from internal handles when possible.
- `value_mut` is the reserved public mode for writable cases; there are not yet checked-in helper examples using it.

Out of scope for the initial rollout:

- `internal_ref`
- receiver-only annotations

If those become necessary, extend them in a separate task.

#### 3.4.4.1 Migration Rules

- Canonical public mode names are `default`, `value`, and `value_mut`.
- For parameters, `value` inherits the old meaning of `value_readonly`.
- For return values, `value` still means a value-return ABI.
- `value_readonly` is removed from the canonical public surface.
  - the source parser may still accept it as a transitional alias
  - even then, `FunctionDef.meta.runtime_abi_v1` must normalize it to `value`
- The previously discussed name `value_mutating` is not adopted. The public name for writable cases is `value_mut`.

#### 3.4.5 Relationship with `@extern`

`@abi` and `@extern` are independent and may be combined.

```python
@extern
def sin(x: float) -> float:
    return __m.sin(x)
```

```python
@abi(args={"parts": "value"}, ret="value")
def py_join(sep: str, parts: list[str]) -> str:
    ...
```

```python
@extern
@abi(args={"image": "value"}, ret="value")
def some_native_helper(image: list[bytearray]) -> bytes:
    ...
```

Meaning:

- with `@extern`
  - do not generate the implementation body; lower to an external symbol
- with `@abi`
  - override the ABI form at the call boundary
- with neither
  - follow the normal internal-representation rules and backend default lowering
- runtime-SoT `@extern` is declaration-only metadata and does not identify the target implementation owner.
- runtime layout / manifest / runtime symbol index define the native implementation owner.
- ambient-global `extern()` / `extern("symbol")` is a separate category from runtime `@extern`.

#### 3.4.6 Why `str.join` Needs It

In the current C++ runtime, `str.join` is intended to use a value ABI close to `str::join(const list<str>& parts)`.

If the runtime helper is generated naively, however, the C++ backend's ref-first internal model may drift `list[str]` toward `rc<list<str>>`. That works against the goal of moving the helper back into pure Python SoT.

Therefore a helper such as `py_join` must be fixed with `@abi`.

```python
@abi(args={"parts": "value"}, ret="value")
def py_join(sep: str, parts: list[str]) -> str:
    ...
```

With this annotation, in C++:

- `parts` is treated as a helper receiving canonical ABI `list<str>`
- the actual declaration may still use `const list<str>&`
- the call site inserts a read-only adapter when it sees `rc<list<str>>`

#### 3.4.7 Constraints

- `@abi` fixes helper ABI only. It does not define module imports, symbol resolution, or semantic tags.
- `@abi` must not leak source-side module knowledge into backends.
- Even when `@abi` is present, the function must not be treated as an external implementation unless `@extern` is also present.
- A contradiction between an `@abi` mode and the function body is a compile error.
  - for example, `append`, `pop`, or assignment against an argument marked `value`
- `@abi` is fail-closed. If a backend/lowerer does not understand the mode, compilation must fail.

#### 3.4.8 EAST / Linked Metadata Shape

`@abi` must be retained not only as decorator syntax but also as function-node metadata.

Raw EAST / raw EAST3 must carry at least:

- `FunctionDef.decorators`
  - may preserve the raw decorator string such as `abi(args={"parts": "value"}, ret="value")`
- `FunctionDef.meta.runtime_abi_v1`
  - canonical metadata for backends and the linker

Canonical metadata shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "args": {
    "parts": "value"
  },
  "ret": "value"
}
```

Rules:

- `schema_version` is required and must be `1`
- `args` is a parameter-name -> mode map
- `ret` is the return mode
- canonical modes are only `default`, `value`, and `value_mut`
- `ret` allows only `default` or `value`, never `value_mut`
- even when the source surface accepts `value_readonly`, canonical metadata must normalize it to `value`
- keys in `args` may be normalized to source parameter order
- omitted `ret` means `default`
- omitted `args` means an empty map

After linked-program processing, `FunctionDef.meta.runtime_abi_v1` must still be preserved, and the linker must not rewrite it. The linker may add only module-level `meta.linked_program_v1` or call/function summaries; the helper ABI contract itself remains sourced from parser/EAST build.

Parser/selfhost-parser acceptance contract:

- the same source must produce the same `runtime_abi_v1` in both implementations
- unsupported forms are rejected fail-closed during EAST build
- even if raw `abi(...)` stays in `decorators`, the only canonical source a backend may read is `meta.runtime_abi_v1`

## 4. External Name (Symbol Name) Rule

For an `@extern` function `M.f`, the external symbol name is:

```text
pytra_<module>_<function>
```

- `<module>` is the Python module name, for example `pytra.std.math` or `pytra.utils.png`
- `<function>` is the function name

Examples:

- `pytra.std.math.sin` -> `pytra_std_math_sin`
- `pytra.utils.png.write_png` -> `pytra_utils_png_write_png`

Notes:

- The module name must be determined uniquely from the package name.
- Nested or local functions are out of scope.
- `@extern` may be limited to top-level functions only.

## 5. ABI Type Determination Rule

### 5.1 Basic Policy

The ABI type is a fixed C++ type derived from the Python type annotation. It must not drift due to optimization.

Treat ABI types as canonical boundary forms.

Mandatory rules:

- the ABI must **not expose internal ownership forms**
- value/container ABI types must not use `rc<>`
- `rc<>` is allowed in the ABI only for reference types that must preserve identity, such as user classes
- `rc<list<T>>` is only an internal alias-preservation / optimization form and is not part of the canonical ABI

`@abi` modes such as `value` and `value_mut` are the annotations that explicitly apply this canonical ABI form to helper boundaries.

### 5.1.1 Backend Internal Representation Default Policy

The canonical ABI form and the initial internal backend representation are separate concerns.

Mandatory rules:

- immutable types such as `str` may use value representation internally by default
- mutable types such as `list`, `dict`, `set`, and `bytearray`, as well as mutable user classes, must use a representation that preserves shared references by default
- in the C++ backend, that shared-reference form may be expressed as `rc<>` or an equivalent handle
- however, that `rc<>` is only an internal representation and must not leak into the ABI

Value lowering is allowed only as an optimization result.

- do not lower mutable values that can exhibit aliasing (`a = b`) into value types without proof
- value lowering requires at least mutation, alias, and escape analysis to prove safety
- interprocedural lowering requires call-graph construction and SCC-level summaries for recursion / mutual recursion
- paths crossing `Any/object`, `@extern`, unknown calls, or unresolved types must fail closed and remain in the shared-reference form

In short: the ABI stays fixed to value-shaped canonical forms such as `list<T>`, while the backend internally uses mutable types in ref-first form and lowers only proven-safe paths afterward.

### 5.2 Canonical Value ABI Forms

Recommended canonical forms in this specification:

```text
bool -> bool

int -> int64
  In Pytra, Python `int` is treated as signed 64-bit integer (`int64`).

float -> float64

str -> str

bytes -> bytes

bytearray -> bytearray

list[T] -> list<ABI(T)>

dict[K,V] -> dict<ABI(K), ABI(V)>

set[T] -> set<ABI(T)>

tuple[T1, T2, ...] -> std::tuple<ABI(T1), ABI(T2), ...>

None (return) -> void
```

Here `ABI(T)` means the canonical ABI form of the element type.

Important:

- the ABI of `list[str]` is `list<str>`, not `list<rc<str>>`
- the ABI of `list[bytearray]` is `list<bytearray>`, not `rc<list<rc<bytearray>>>`
- the ABI of `dict[str, int]` is `dict<str, int64>`
- even if the internal form of `list[int]` is reduced to `rc<list<int64>>`, the ABI stays `list<int64>`

### 5.3 Canonical Reference ABI Forms

The following may be treated as reference ABI types rather than value ABI types:

```text
Any / object -> object

user class C -> rc<C>

runtime objects that require identity -> existing runtime reference type
```

Examples:

- `Animal` -> `rc<Animal>`
- `Token` -> `rc<Token>`
- `object` / `Any` -> `object`

In other words, `rc<>` is not globally banned; it is forbidden only for value ABI.

### 5.4 C++ Parameter Declaration Forms

The ABI type itself and the concrete C++ declaration form are separate concerns.

Example:

- ABI type: `list<bytearray>`
- possible C++ declaration forms:
  - `const list<bytearray>& image`
  - `list<bytearray> image`
  - `list<bytearray>& image`

Which declaration form to use depends on mutation, copy cost, and backend policy.  
However, **the canonical element form (`list<bytearray>`) must not change**.

## 6. ABI Adaptation Rules

### 6.1 Insertion Point

When lowering an `@extern` call or a helper call annotated with `@abi` into an ABI-fixed boundary, for each argument:

1. obtain the internal type `Tin` of the actual argument
2. obtain the fixed ABI type `Tabi`
3. if `Tin == Tabi`, pass through directly
4. otherwise insert `adapt(Tin -> Tabi)` and pass the adapted value

### 6.2 Adaptation Function Shape

Adaptation may be expressed in generated code like:

```cpp
adapt_to_abi<list<bytearray>>(x)
```

The concrete function name is backend-defined, but its responsibility is limited to:

- normalization from internal type to fixed ABI type
- no unnecessary conversion when the mapping is a no-op

### 6.3 Required Conversion Cases (Example: `list[bytearray]`)

For `Tabi = list<bytearray>`, at least the following must be handled:

- Case 1: `Tin = list<bytearray>` -> no-op
- Case 2: `Tin = list<rc<bytearray>>` -> normalize each element into `bytearray` and build `list<bytearray>`
- Case 3: `Tin = rc<list<bytearray>>` -> remove the outer `rc<>` and construct `list<bytearray>`
- Case 4: `Tin = rc<list<rc<bytearray>>>` -> remove the outer `rc<>`, normalize each element, and construct `list<bytearray>`

Other incoming types may be treated as compile errors.

### 6.4 Additional Rule for `@abi(args={"x": "value"})`

For a parameter `x` annotated as `@abi(args={"x": "value"})`, the backend must obey:

- the canonical ABI form is value ABI
- the target-language declaration may use a read-only borrow
- in C++, `const T&` is allowed
- if a read-only borrow from an internal handle such as `rc<list<T>>` is possible, do not insert an unnecessary copy
- if borrowing is impossible, insert an adapter fail-closed

### 6.5 Additional Rule for `@abi(args={"x": "value_mut"})`

For a parameter `x` annotated as `@abi(args={"x": "value_mut"})`, the backend must obey:

- the canonical ABI form is value ABI
- the callee may mutate the argument destructively
- adapter elision via read-only borrow is forbidden
- when the target cannot express a writable borrow, insert an adapter/copy fail-closed

### 6.6 Additional Rule for `@abi(ret="value")`

`ret="value"` fixes the return value to the canonical value ABI.

This prevents generated helpers from leaking internal ref-first representations directly across the boundary.

### 6.7 Adaptation Cost Policy

ABI adaptation may involve copying or reconstruction, but the governing policy is:

- prioritize a fixed ABI at external boundaries
- insert conversions only when required
- functions such as `write_png` are I/O-oriented and usually do not make boundary copies dominant
- if performance becomes a problem, design a dedicated ABI such as span, pointer+size, or writable buffer case by case

## 7. Generated C++ Declarations and Linking

### 7.1 How Declarations Are Provided

External function declarations may be provided in either of the following ways:

- Method 1: the transpiler auto-generates forward declarations only for used external functions
- Method 2: a common header is always included and contains the declarations

Both are permitted, but Method 1 is recommended initially.

### 7.2 About `extern "C"`

The "ABI" in this document means **Pytra's fixed boundary types**, not plain C ABI.

Therefore:

- `extern "C"` may be used to suppress name mangling
- but when types such as `list<bytearray>` or `dict<str, int64>` appear, that does not mean the function is directly callable from C

`extern "C"` is optional, but acceptable for symbol-name stabilization.

## 8. Specification Constraints

- An `@extern` function may use a stub body (`...` / `pass`) or a Python-executable body.
- When lowered into the target language, its body is replaced by the external implementation.
- It is recommended that `@extern` functions require type annotations for parameters and returns.
- `@extern` may be restricted to top-level functions only.
- The usage restriction on `import ... as __name` (host-only import) is mandatory.

## 9. Example (`write_png`)

Python:

```python
from pytra import extern

@extern
def write_png(image: list[bytearray]) -> None: ...
```

ABI types:

- `image: list<bytearray>`
- return: `void`

Generated conceptually:

```cpp
extern "C" void pytra_utils_png_write_png(const list<bytearray>& image);

void callsite(...) {
    auto image_abi = adapt_to_abi<list<bytearray>>(image_in);
    pytra_utils_png_write_png(image_abi);
}
```

External implementation:

```cpp
extern "C" void pytra_utils_png_write_png(const list<bytearray>& image) {
    // PNG write logic
}
```

## 10. Implementation Checklist

- detect functions annotated with `@extern` from AST/EAST
- derive ABI types uniquely from Python type annotations
- derive the external name `pytra_<module>_<func>` uniquely
- compare `(Tin, Tabi)` at call sites and insert `adapt` when needed
- normalize representative cases such as `list[bytearray]` into ABI despite multiple internal forms
- generate external function declarations (forward decl or runtime header)

## 11. Runtime Directory Layout Assumptions

The canonical runtime layout follows [`spec-runtime.md`](./spec-runtime.md).

Key points assumed here for the current C++ runtime:

- `runtime/cpp/generated/{built_in,std,utils,compiler}/`
- `runtime/cpp/native/{built_in,std,utils,compiler}/`
- `runtime/cpp/generated/core/`
- `runtime/cpp/native/core/`

Ownership rules:

- declarations and thin wrappers generated from SoT go in `generated/`
- minimal native implementations that glue to OS / SDK / the C++ standard library go in `native/`
- low-level core ownership is split between `generated/core` and `native/core`

Notes:

- C++ module-runtime ownership is distinguished by directories, not suffixes.
- suffix-based module runtime under `src/runtime/cpp/{built_in,std,utils}` is legacy-closed and must not be reintroduced
- `core` ownership is split into `runtime/cpp/generated/core/` and `runtime/cpp/native/core/`, with no checked-in `runtime/cpp/core/*.h` compatibility surface
- the ABI policy itself does not change

## 12. Example: `pytra.std.math`

Because `src/pytra/std/math.py` contains `@extern`, the C++ runtime is structured as:

- generated declarations:
  - `runtime/cpp/generated/std/math.h`
- native implementation:
  - `runtime/cpp/native/std/math.cpp`
Important:

- `math` is header-only on the generated side, so `runtime/cpp/generated/std/math.cpp` is not emitted
- `math.cpp` provides the native implementation for `math.h`
- generated code includes `runtime/cpp/generated/std/math.h`, while the build graph resolves the generated/native ownership
- manifest/build inputs follow the layout rules in `spec-runtime.md`

In other words, even for modules containing `@extern`,

- ABI types are fixed to canonical value/reference forms
- generated artifacts and native implementations stay visibly separated by ownership
- `rc<>` is kept inside internal representations instead of being exposed in the ABI
