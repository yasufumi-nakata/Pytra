# Import Specification

Read `docs/en/spec/spec-runtime.md` first.

## `__future__` Import Handling (EAST Stage)

- `from __future__ import annotations` is accepted as a frontend-only directive, but it is not emitted into EAST.
- This directive must not remain in `meta.import_bindings`, `meta.import_symbols`, or `meta.qualified_symbol_refs`.
- Other `__future__` features (for example `generator_stop`) and `from __future__ import *` are rejected as `unsupported_syntax` (fail-closed).

## `typing` Import Handling (annotation-only no-op)

- `import typing` and `from typing import ...` are accepted for annotation resolution only.
- These `typing` imports are not emitted into EAST, `meta.import_bindings`, or dependency graphs (no-op import).
- Imported typing aliases (for example `List`, `Dict`, `Any`, `Optional`) are used only by frontend type-alias resolution.
- No runtime include/import dependency should be introduced from `typing` imports.

## `dataclasses` Import Handling (decorator-resolution no-op)

- `import dataclasses` / `import dataclasses as ...` and `from dataclasses import ...` are accepted only for decorator resolution.
- These `dataclasses` imports are not emitted into EAST, `meta.import_bindings`, or dependency graphs (no-op import).
- `@dataclass` / `@dataclass(...)` / `@dataclasses.dataclass(...)` are handled as dataclass-class markers in EAST.
- Decorator arguments are accepted only in keyword-bool form (`name=True/False`).

## Relative `from-import` Handling (Stage 1 static normalization)

- This section fixes the target contract for relative imports. Implementation rollout is staged, but syntax / diagnostics / root-escape policy are defined here as the source of truth.
- Stage 1 accepts only the following relative forms:
  - `from .m import x`
  - `from ..pkg import y`
  - `from .. import helper`
  - `from . import x`
  - `from .m import *`
- Illegal Python syntax such as `import .m` is never accepted.
- The parser may keep the relative module text raw, but frontend module-map construction must normalize it into an absolute `module_id` before validation and backend handoff.
- Normalization is based on the importing file path and the entry-root module layout; runtime `__package__` / `__main__` are not used.
- If the relative import escapes above the entry root, it fails as `input_invalid(kind=relative_import_escape)` and the detail line must include the original import text.
- If normalization succeeds but the target module does not exist, it fails as `input_invalid(kind=missing_module)`, the same as absolute imports.
- `missing_symbol`, `duplicate_binding`, and `unresolved_wildcard` for relative imports are evaluated against the normalized absolute `module_id`, using the existing absolute-import contract.
- After frontend normalization, `ImportFrom.module`, `meta.import_bindings[].module_id`, `meta.import_symbols[*].module`, and `meta.qualified_symbol_refs[*].module_id` must all be absolute module IDs.

This document defines how syntax like the following is converted in `py2cpp.py`.

```python
from X import Y
```

Core idea: because import source `X` is fixed, generate code that includes `X`'s header.

```cpp
#include "X"
```

Then allow access only to `Y` at the transpiler name-resolution layer (other symbols are not registered in the symbol table).
Even though C++ visibility still allows access due to include behavior, such accesses must be rejected as transpilation-time errors.

Name collisions are another concern when names happen to overlap across already loaded modules. Example:

```python
from X import Y
from Z import *
```

Assume `X` internally has variable `z`, and `from Z import *` also introduces another `z`.
Then a statement like `W = z` becomes ambiguous in generated C++ and can cause compile errors.

A practical direction is to place each module in a namespace during `py2cpp.py` conversion, for example:

```text
namespace folder_path::X {

}
```

This works for C++, but what about languages without namespaces?
Should namespace-like prefixes be attached to symbol names?

## Addendum: Concerns

- `from module import *` is accepted as `binding_kind=wildcard` and resolved in frontend import analysis. Static-undecidable cases fail closed as `input_invalid(kind=unresolved_wildcard)`.
- `#include` alone cannot enforce C++ visibility restrictions, so `from X import Y` constraints must be guaranteed by transpiler name resolution.
- The allowed symbol kinds for `from X import Y` (function/class/constant/variable), and whether `X.Y` access is allowed/forbidden, need explicit specification.
- Priority on collisions between import names and local names (local/arg/import alias/builtin) must be fixed to avoid per-language behavior drift.

## Addendum: Implementation Ideas (Detailed)

### 0. Fix Target Scope First (Freeze Spec First)

- Phase-1 supported forms are strictly limited to:
  - `import M`
  - `import M as A`
  - `from M import S`
  - `from M import S as A`
- In phase 1, accept `from M import *` as wildcard binding and expand it with `__all__` priority / public-name fallback.
- In phase 1, also accept relative `from-import` (`from .m import x`, `from ..pkg import y`, `from .. import helper`, `from . import x`, `from .m import *`) and normalize it into an absolute `module_id` in the frontend.

### 1. Fix Input Data Structure for Dependency Analysis Phase

- Extract import data from EAST in this structure:

```text
ImportBinding
- module_id: str              # normalized module name (e.g. pytra.std.time, foo.bar)
- export_name: str            # original symbol name for from-import (empty for import M)
- local_name: str             # bound name in current scope (after alias)
- binding_kind: str           # "module" | "symbol"
- source_file: str            # input file path
- source_line: int            # keep when possible
```

- `import M as A` becomes `binding_kind=module, module_id=M, local_name=A`.
- `from M import S as A` becomes `binding_kind=symbol, module_id=M, export_name=S, local_name=A`.
- Add analysis results to `meta.import_modules` / `meta.import_symbols`, but keep `ImportBinding[]` as internal source of truth.

### 2. Centralize Module Resolution Rules in One Place

- Module resolution must always go through `resolve_module_name(raw_name, root_dir)`.
- Fix resolution order as follows:
  - `pytra.*` resolves first as reserved namespace.
  - Otherwise search user modules (`foo/bar.py`, `foo/bar/__init__.py`).
  - If neither resolves, record in `missing_modules`.
  - If `pytra.py` / `pytra/__init__.py` exists under input root, add to `reserved_conflicts` and fail with `input_invalid`.

### 3. Build Module Export Symbol Table (ExportTable)

- For validating `from M import S`, pre-collect export symbols for each module.
- In phase 1, exported symbols are fixed as:
  - top-level `FunctionDef.name`
  - top-level `ClassDef.name`
  - identifiers assigned by top-level `Assign/AnnAssign` to `Name`
- Importing undefined `S` fails with `input_invalid`.
- Error messages must include `module_id`, `symbol`, and `source_file`.

### 4. Specify Name Resolution Algorithm

- Fix reference-resolution priority (higher first):
  - local variables in current scope
  - function arguments
  - class members (via `self.x`)
  - imported symbol aliases (`A` in `from M import S as A`)
  - imported module aliases (`A` in `import M as A`)
  - builtins
- Same-priority same-name collisions fail with `input_invalid`.
  - Example: `from a import x` and `from b import x` in same module should raise collision error.
- After `from M import S`, references like `M.T` are not allowed (`M` is not bound).

### 5. Fix C++ Generation Rules

- Generate includes from `ImportBinding` with deduplication + stable sort.
- Even for `binding_kind=symbol`, always normalize emitted C++ references to `module_namespace::export_name`.
- Example:

```python
from foo.bar import add as plus
x = plus(1, 2)
```

```cpp
#include "foo/bar.h"
auto x = pytra_mod_foo__bar::add(1, 2);
```

- In other words, alias use is allowed in source, but generated code always lowers to fully-qualified names.
- This avoids ambiguous C++ references even when different modules have same symbol names.

### 6. Fix single-file / multi-file Consistency

- Unify namespace decisions through one route: `module_namespace_map[module_id] -> cpp_namespace`.
- Use the same `module_namespace_map` for single-file and multi-file modes.
- In multi-file mode, forward declaration generation must also use only `module_namespace_map` (no separate logic).
- Require that import-resolution results do not change by conversion mode.

### 7. Fix Error Categories and Reporting Format

- Unify all import-related failures under `input_invalid`.
- `detail` lines must include at least:
  - `kind`: `missing_module | missing_symbol | duplicate_binding | reserved_conflict | unresolved_wildcard | relative_import_escape`
  - `file`: input file
  - `import`: original import string (reconstructed string is acceptable)
- Example:
  - `kind=missing_symbol file=app.py import=from foo import bar`
- Root-escape relative imports are reported in the same format, for example `kind=relative_import_escape file=pkg/main.py import=from ...oops import f`.

### 8. Minimal Test Matrix (Acceptance Criteria)

- Positive cases:
  - `import M` / `import M as A` / `from M import S` / `from M import S as A`
  - `from .m import x` / `from ..pkg import y` / `from .. import helper` / `from . import x`
  - no collision at call site due to full qualification even when same-name symbols exist across modules
- Negative cases:
  - `from M import *` (accepted; unresolved/static-undecidable wildcard must fail as `kind=unresolved_wildcard`)
  - `from ...oops import x` (entry-root escape must fail as `kind=relative_import_escape`)
  - non-existing module/symbol
  - duplicate same-name alias
  - dependency resolution result is identical between `--dump-deps` and normal conversion

## Addendum: Policy for Other Target Languages (Detailed)

### A. Fix Responsibilities of Language-agnostic IR

- Complete import semantic interpretation in front-end; backend must not reinterpret it.
- Normalize references passed to backend in this shape:

```text
QualifiedSymbolRef
- module_id: str      # e.g. foo.bar
- symbol: str         # e.g. add
- local_name: str     # e.g. plus (name in source)
```

- `Name("plus")` in expression should be resolved before backend into `QualifiedSymbolRef(module_id="foo.bar", symbol="add")`.
- This limits language differences to emission syntax only.

### B. Mapping Rules by Backend Category

- Category 1: languages with namespace/module path (C++, Rust, C#, etc.)
  - Map `module_id` to language namespace syntax and emit qualified access.
  - Example: `foo.bar.add` / `foo::bar::add` / `foo.bar::add` depending on language.
- Category 2: languages with file split but weak namespaces
  - Mangle symbols into `module_prefix + symbol` to avoid collisions.
  - Example: `foo_bar__add(...)`.
- Category 3: languages with mostly flat global namespace
  - Mangle all public symbols and guarantee uniqueness in generated artifacts.

### C. Common Name-mangling Specification

- Provide shared algorithm for non-namespace languages.
- `mangled = "__pytra__" + encode(module_id) + "__" + encode(symbol)`
- `encode`: convert characters outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` into `_xx` (two-digit hex).
- If leading char becomes numeric, prefix with `_`.
- Re-check collisions after mangling; if still colliding, fail with `input_invalid`.

### D. Complete Import-constraint Checks in Front-end

- Validate `from M import S`, duplicates, unresolved names, and unsupported forms before IR reaches backend.
- Backend should only emit already-resolved `QualifiedSymbolRef`.
- This reduces language-specific drift such as "passes in C++ but fails in other targets".

### E. Minimum Contract Tests per Backend

- For code generated from same input, verify consistency of:
  - resolved target module/symbol pairs (`module_id/symbol`)
  - alias resolution results
  - collision detection results (success/failure)
- Test criterion should be identity of resolution results, not syntax-level similarity.

## Addendum: Concrete Per-language Implementation Policy (Aligned with `README.md` / `docs/ja/plans/pytra-wip.md`)

Supported targets: `C++ / Rust / C# / JavaScript / TypeScript / Go / Java / Swift / Kotlin / Ruby / Lua`.

### 1. C++ (`src/py2cpp.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - Parse imports through EAST and resolve using `module_namespace_map` and `meta.import_symbols`.
  - Do not emit import statements directly into C++; reflect them via `#include` and name-resolution tables.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Generate includes from canonical `ImportBinding` (dedup + stable sort).
  - For `from M import S as A`, never emit `A` directly; normalize to `ns_of(M)::S` at reference sites.
  - Use the same `module_namespace_map` in single-file and multi-file modes; no rule drift.
- Error policy:
  - unresolved wildcard, relative import, unresolved module, unresolved symbol, and duplicate alias all fail as `input_invalid`.

### 2. Rust (`src/py2rs.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - Native AST conversion. Current `Import/ImportFrom` is skipped at module top.
  - Call resolution is handled at expression level (e.g. `math.sqrt`, `pathlib.Path`, `perf_counter`).
- Concrete implementation:
  - Run import analysis first and build internal table `alias -> canonical symbol`.
  - Examples:
    - `from time import perf_counter as pc`: normalize `pc()` to `perf_counter()` before existing lowering.
    - `from pathlib import Path as P`: normalize `P(...)` to `Path(...)`.
    - `from math import sqrt as s`: lower `s(x)` to `math_sqrt(...)`.
  - Keep runtime integration through `py_runtime`; import only used symbols via `use py_runtime::{...}`.
- Error policy:
  - unresolved wildcard and relative import should be reported as `input_invalid` (wildcard uses `kind=unresolved_wildcard`).

### 3. C# (`src/py2cs.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - Convert imports into `using` lines; map expression-level calls to `Pytra.CsModule.py_runtime.*` and `System.Math`.
  - `_using_lines_from_import` and `_map_python_module` are import entry points.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Generate `using` from `ImportBinding`.
  - `import math as m` -> `using m = System;`
  - `from pathlib import Path as P` should not map directly to `using P = System.IO.Path;`; instead align with Pytra runtime path for `pathlib.Path` equivalence.
  - Keep existing `typing_aliases` route and register from-import names into type-resolution tables.
  - Keep `py_module`/`pylib` compatibility and gradually converge names to `pytra.*`.
- Error policy:
  - Use frontend-resolved wildcard references and fail only when wildcard cannot be resolved statically.
  - Same-name alias collision fails immediately as `duplicate_binding`.

### 4. JavaScript (`src/py2js.py` + `src/backends/js/emitter/js_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - Native AST conversion, runtime modules loaded by `require(...)`.
  - Import resolution handled by `_transpile_import`.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Generate `const ... = require(...)` or destructuring assignments from `ImportBinding`.
  - `import math as m` -> `const m = require(.../math.js)`
  - `from time import perf_counter as pc` -> `const pc = perfCounter`
  - `from pathlib import Path as P` -> `const P = pathlib.Path`
  - `from pytra.utils.gif import save_gif as sg` -> `const { save_gif: sg } = require(.../gif.js)`
  - Add lazy emission based on reference counts (emit require only for used bindings).
- Error policy:
  - Consume frontend-resolved import metadata; unresolved wildcard must be rejected in frontend before JS emission.

### 5. TypeScript (`src/py2ts.py` + `src/backends/ts/emitter/ts_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - Same conversion logic as JS (only runtime extension differs: `.ts`).
- Concrete implementation:
  - Use same `ImportBinding` resolution as JS.
  - Keep `require`-style output for runtime compatibility (`tsx` execution path).
  - Add minimal type annotations for import aliases when needed to preserve type information (future extension).
- Error policy:
  - Same as JS. Unsupported import fails during conversion.

### 6. Go (`src/py2go.py` + `src/backends/go/emitter/go_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion. `py2go.py` is a thin CLI and the default output is produced by the Go native emitter.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Import resolution uses EAST `meta.import_bindings` as the source of truth and does not re-emit Python import statements in native output.
  - Generated output is standalone native Go (`package main` + runtime helpers + lowered program body).
  - Sidecar compatibility mode has been removed; only the native path is supported.
- Error policy:
  - Unsupported input fails closed on frontend/EAST side before Go code generation.

### 7. Java (`src/py2java.py` + `src/backends/java/emitter/java_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion via Java native emitter. Java runtime is `PyRuntime.java`.
  - Python imports are not expanded into Java import lines directly; lowered to `PyRuntime.*` calls.
- Concrete implementation:
  - As in Go, normalize aliases first using `ImportBinding`.
  - `from time import perf_counter as pc` -> `PyRuntime.pyPerfCounter()`
  - `from pathlib import Path as P` -> `PyRuntime.pyPathNew(...)`
  - `from math import sin as s` -> `PyRuntime.pyMathSin(...)`
  - Route module-attribute calls to explicit `PyRuntime` methods and forbid ambiguous `Object` method calls.
- Error policy:
  - Unresolved methods currently fail as `TranspileError("cannot resolve method call: ...")`; move detection to import-resolution phase and unify message format.

### 8. Swift (`src/py2swift.py` + `src/backends/swift/emitter/swift_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion. `py2swift.py` is a thin CLI and the default output is produced by the Swift native emitter.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Import resolution uses EAST `meta.import_bindings` as the source of truth and does not re-emit Python import statements in native output.
  - Generated output is native Swift source (`runtime helper` functions + lowered bodies + `@main` entry).
  - Sidecar compatibility mode has been removed; only the native path is supported.
- Error policy:
  - Unsupported input fails closed on frontend/EAST side before Swift code generation.

### 9. Kotlin (`src/py2kotlin.py` + `src/backends/kotlin/emitter/kotlin_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion. `py2kotlin.py` is a thin CLI and the default output is produced by the Kotlin native emitter.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Import resolution uses EAST `meta.import_bindings` as the source of truth and does not re-emit Python import statements in native output.
  - Generated output is standalone native Kotlin (`runtime helper` functions + lowered bodies + `main` entry).
  - Sidecar compatibility mode has been removed; only the native path is supported.
- Error policy:
  - Unsupported input fails closed on frontend/EAST side before Kotlin code generation.

### 10. Ruby (`src/py2rb.py` + `src/backends/ruby/emitter/ruby_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion. `py2rb.py` is a thin CLI and the default output is handled by the Ruby native emitter.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Import resolution treats EAST `meta.import_bindings` as the source of truth and does not re-emit Python import lines in native output.
  - Generated code is standalone native Ruby output.
- Error policy:
  - Unsupported syntax must fail on the frontend/EAST side and must not proceed to Ruby output.

### 11. Lua (`src/py2lua.py` + `src/backends/lua/emitter/lua_native_emitter.py`)

- Implementation style:
  - EAST3 conversion. `py2lua.py` is a thin CLI and the default output is handled by the Lua native emitter.
- Concrete implementation:
  - Import resolution treats EAST `meta.import_bindings` as the source of truth and does not re-emit Python import lines in native output.
  - `math` maps to Lua standard `math`; `pytra.utils png/gif` maps to the staged runtime stubs.
- Error policy:
  - Unsupported syntax must fail closed and must not proceed to Lua output.

### 12. Recommended Integration Order Across Languages

- Step 1: complete `ImportBinding` / `QualifiedSymbolRef` in C++ implementation (EAST path).
- Step 2: port the same resolver to JS/TS shared base.
- Step 3: align import alias normalization for Go/Swift/Kotlin native emitters.
- Step 4: remove sidecar compatibility paths; default regressions must run on native paths only.
- Step 5: add import preprocessing tables to Rust/C# without breaking existing behavior.
