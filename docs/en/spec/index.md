## How to read it

- If you want tool usage, input constraints, or how to run tests:
  [User Specification](./spec-user.md)
- If you want differences from Python or unsupported features:
  [Python Compatibility Guide](./spec-python-compat.md)
- If you want to check `import` rules, the unified `pytra.*` rules, usable types, or the module list:

  [Runtime Specification](./spec-runtime.md)
- If you want the boxing and unboxing contract at the `Any/object` boundary:
  [Boxing and Unboxing Specification](./spec-boxing.md)
- If you want the single-inheritance `type_id` contract for `isinstance` and `issubclass`:

  [Language Profile Specification](./spec-language-profile.md)
- If you want to know what belongs in which folder and why:
  [Folder Responsibility Map Specification](./spec-folder.md)
- If you want to understand how EAST is operated as three stages, EAST1, EAST2, and EAST3:
  [EAST Stages](./spec-east.md#east-stages)
- If you want the responsibilities and contracts of the EAST3 optimizer layer, shared and language-specific:
  [EAST3 Optimizer Specification](./spec-east3-optimizer.md)
- If you want the responsibility split for later C++ backend optimization, `CppOptimizer` versus `CppEmitter`:
  [C++ Optimizer Specification](./spec-cpp-optimizer.md)
- If you want the C++ list aliasing, sharing, and destructive-update contract, including the value/pyobj migration boundary:
  [C++ List Reference Semantics](./spec-cpp-list-reference-semantics.md)
- If you want the contract that `pytra/std` is the source of truth for type signatures, replacing hard-coded logic in `core.py`:
  [stdlib Signature Source-of-Truth](./spec-stdlib-signature-source-of-truth.md)
- If you want the Java backend migration contract for removing sidecars, input responsibility, fail-closed, and runtime boundary:

- If you want the migration order until EAST3 becomes the main path:
  [EAST Migration Phases](./spec-east.md#east-migration-phases)
- If you want the EAST3 linking stage, `type_id` resolution, manifest handling, or intermediate-file resume:
  [Linker Specification](./spec-linker.md)
- If you want feature support by language:
  [Language-Specific Specifications](../language/index.md)

- If you want older, no longer current specifications:
  [Specification Archive](./archive/index.md)
- If you want the design philosophy and background of the EAST-centered architecture:
  [Development Philosophy](./spec-philosophy.md)

## What Codex checks at startup

- At startup, Codex reads `docs/ja/spec/index.md` as the entry point, then checks the [Codex Operation Specification](./spec-codex.md) and [TODO](../todo/index.md).
