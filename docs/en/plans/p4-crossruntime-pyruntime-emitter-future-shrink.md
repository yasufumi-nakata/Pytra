# P4 Crossruntime PyRuntime Emitter Future Shrink

Last updated: 2026-03-12

Purpose:
- Define the remaining C++ / Rust / C# emitter follow-up needed before `py_runtime.h` can shrink further or the thin seams can move elsewhere.
- Treat the archived `P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-SHRINK-01` / `...-RESIDUAL-REDUCTION-01` result as the current baseline and make the next low-priority follow-up visible again.
- Fix the bundle order for reducing the remaining `shared type_id thin seam` and the C# `bytearray` compatibility seam before a future header-shrink or runtime SoT task.

Background:
- The earlier emitter-shrink P4 tasks are already archived, and the current residual inventory is now fixed in [check_crossruntime_pyruntime_emitter_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/check_crossruntime_pyruntime_emitter_inventory.py).
- The current residuals are intentional seams rather than unclassified debt, but further `py_runtime.h` shrink will still require emitter-side follow-up across C++ / Rust / C#.
- In particular, the C++ emitter still uses `py_runtime_value_*` / `py_runtime_type_id_is_*`, Rust/C# still carry the shared thin helper contract, and C# still keeps a `bytearray` mutation compatibility seam.
- This is not an immediate blocker, so it belongs in low-priority `P4`.

Out of scope:
- Fully shrinking `py_runtime.h` in this task.
- Rewriting the Rust / C# runtime builtins wholesale.
- Introducing a new object system or type-id model.

Acceptance criteria:
- The current emitter residual baseline and future bundle order are fixed in the live TODO / plan / inventory tool.
- The remaining seams across C++ / Rust / C# are classified in terms of `future_reducible` vs `must_remain_until_runtime_task`.
- Representative smoke / source guard / inventory drift guards cover the future-shrink baseline.
- The handoff condition to a later `py_runtime.h` shrink or runtime SoT task is written down.
- The English mirror stays in sync with the Japanese source of truth.

## Child Tasks

- [x] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-FUTURE-SHRINK-01-S1-01] Lock the future-shrink follow-up baseline and bundle order into the live plan / TODO / inventory tool.
- [ ] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-FUTURE-SHRINK-01-S2-01] Re-audit the C++ emitter shared type-id thin seam and classify reducible callers vs must-remain seam.
- [ ] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-FUTURE-SHRINK-01-S2-02] Re-audit the Rust / C# shared thin helper seam and the C# bytearray compatibility seam, then lock the future reduction order.
- [ ] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-FUTURE-SHRINK-01-S3-01] Refresh representative smoke / source guard / inventory drift guard for the future-shrink baseline.
- [ ] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-FUTURE-SHRINK-01-S4-01] Connect the future emitter shrink handoff to the next header-shrink / runtime-SoT task.

## Current Baseline

- `cpp_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
  - `py_runtime_value_type_id`
  - `py_runtime_value_isinstance`
  - `py_runtime_type_id_is_subtype`
  - `py_runtime_type_id_issubclass`
  - source guard paths:
    - `src/backends/cpp/emitter/cpp_emitter.py`
    - `src/backends/cpp/emitter/runtime_expr.py`
    - `src/backends/cpp/emitter/stmt.py`
- `rs_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
  - the same 4 helper names
  - source guard path:
    - `src/backends/rs/emitter/rs_emitter.py`
- `cs_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
  - the same 4 helper names
  - source guard path:
    - `src/backends/cs/emitter/cs_emitter.py`
- `crossruntime_mutation_helper_residual`
  - `py_append`
  - `py_pop`
  - source guard path:
    - `src/backends/cs/emitter/cs_emitter.py`
  - current interpretation:
    - `bytearray` compatibility seam only

## Future Reduction Order

1. `cpp_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
2. `rs_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
3. `cs_emitter_shared_type_id_residual`
4. `crossruntime_mutation_helper_residual`

## Handoff Condition

- The C++ emitter must not reintroduce generic or object-type-id aliases beyond the current thin helper seam.
- The Rust / C# emitters must not grow the shared thin helper surface.
- The C# `bytearray` compatibility seam must not expand back to list / bytes mutation.
- Once those remain fixed in the inventory tool, this task hands off to a later header-shrink / runtime-externalization task.

## Decision Log

- 2026-03-12: The archived `P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-EMITTER-SHRINK-01` / `...-RESIDUAL-REDUCTION-01` tasks already completed the current residual cleanup, so this follow-up is limited to future reduction only.
- 2026-03-12: `S1-01` fixes the current residual inventory as the baseline and sets the future reduction order to `C++ shared type_id -> Rust shared type_id -> C# shared type_id -> C# bytearray compat`.
