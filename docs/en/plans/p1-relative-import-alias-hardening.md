# P1: Lock the representative contract for aliased relative imports

Last updated: 2026-03-12

Related TODO:
- `ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01` in `docs/ja/todo/index.md`

Background:
- Sibling / parent relative `from-import` is already implemented, and `from .helper import f`, `from ..util import two`, and `from .. import helper` are covered by representative regressions.
- However, relative imports that use `as` aliases are not yet fully closed out in docs and focused tests.
- In nested package layouts such as Pytra-NES, patterns like `from .. import helper as h` and `from ..helper import f as g` are realistic, so leaving them without locked regressions makes regressions slower to detect.

Goal:
- Lock the current support for aliased relative `from-import` across the import graph, CLI, C++ multi-file smoke, and spec/support matrix.

Scope:
- `from .helper import f as g`
- `from ..helper import f as g`
- `from .. import helper as h`
- Alias carriers in import graph / module metadata
- `py2x.py --target cpp` single-file / multi-file regressions
- Representative examples in support matrix / import spec

Out of scope:
- New relative import implementation
- Python-illegal syntax such as `import .m`
- New wildcard import functionality
- Changing relative-import root-escape policy

Acceptance criteria:
- `from .. import helper as h` passes as current support in import graph and CLI / C++ smoke.
- `from ..helper import f as g` and `from .helper import f as g` pass as current support in CLI / C++ smoke.
- In import graph / metadata, module aliases normalize to `binding_kind=module`, and symbol aliases normalize through `import_symbols`.
- Spec / support matrix explicitly mention the alias representative cases and do not contradict the implementation contract.

Verification commands:
- `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/common -p 'test_relative_import_semantics.py'`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/common -p 'test_import_graph_issue_structure.py'`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/tooling -p 'test_py2x_cli.py'`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/backends/cpp -p 'test_py2cpp_features.py' -k relative_import_alias`
- `git diff --check`

Decision log:
- 2026-03-12: After TODO became empty, filed this `P1` follow-up to lock the current relative-import contract through Pytra-NES-style alias cases.

## Breakdown

- [ ] [ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01-S1-01] Lock the target contract and representative scope for aliased relative imports in the plan / TODO.
- [ ] [ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01-S2-01] Lock module-alias and symbol-alias metadata carriers with focused import-graph / normalization tests.
- [ ] [ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01-S2-02] Lock current support for aliased relative imports in `py2x.py` and C++ multi-file smoke tests.
- [ ] [ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01-S3-01] Sync representative alias cases into `spec-import` and the C++ support matrix.
