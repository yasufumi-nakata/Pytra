# P0: Align the `rs/cs` runtimes to a C++-comparable `generated/native` layout

Last updated: 2026-03-12

Related TODO:
- `docs/ja/todo/index.md` `ID: P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01`

Background:
- The current `rs/cs` runtimes still depend on `pytra-core/pytra-gen/pytra` naming, while C++ already has a clearer ownership split under `generated/native/core/pytra`.
- That makes tree-level comparison harder: for modules such as `json/pathlib/gif/png/...`, it is not obvious whether a backend is missing a generated artifact or still hiding handwritten logic in the core lane.
- Per the user directive, anything placed under `generated/` must be emitted from the SoT (`src/pytra/**`). Moving handwritten files into `generated/` is invalid.
- Per the later user directive, `rs/cs` stay in P0 and the remaining non-C++ backends move to a separate P1 rollout.

Goal:
- Make `rs/cs` use `generated/` and `native/` as formal runtime lanes so their trees can be compared against C++ at the file/module level.
- Keep `generated/` strictly SoT-generated and `native/` strictly handwritten.
- Materialize `generated/built_in/*` for `rs/cs` from `src/pytra/built_in/*.py`, not only `std/utils`.

Scope:
- `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/**`
- `tools/gen_runtime_from_manifest.py`
- `tools/runtime_generation_manifest.json`
- `src/toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_metadata.py`
- `src/toolchain/compiler/pytra_cli_profiles.py`
- runtime guards / allowlists / docs

Out of scope:
- redesigning the C++ runtime itself
- rolling the remaining non-`rs/cs` backends
- immediately deleting the `pytra/` public shim lane

Acceptance criteria:
- `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/generated/**` exists and contains only generated artifacts with `source:` and `generated-by:` markers.
- `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/native/**` exists and does not contain `generated-by:` markers.
- `tools/runtime_generation_manifest.json` emits `rs/cs` SoT artifacts into `generated/`.
- `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/generated/built_in/*` exists for the `src/pytra/built_in/*.py` modules and can be compared to `cpp/generated/built_in/*` by `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>`.
- `backend_registry_metadata.py`, `pytra_cli_profiles.py`, and selfhost checks reference the new `rs/cs` layout.
- Runtime guards no longer treat `pytra-gen/pytra-core` as the canonical vocabulary; `generated/native` becomes the primary audited layout.
- When runtime trees are compared by `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>`, missing vs. lingering runtime modules in `rs/cs` are obvious from the filesystem alone.

Planned verification:
- `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py`
- `python3 tools/check_runtime_core_gen_markers.py`
- `python3 tools/check_runtime_pytra_gen_naming.py`
- `python3 tools/check_runtime_std_sot_guard.py`
- `python3 tools/check_cs_single_source_selfhost_compile.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src:.:test/unit python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/backends/cs -p 'test_py2cs_smoke.py'`

Execution policy:
1. Do not move handwritten files into `generated/`; regenerate them from the SoT through the manifest/generator lane.
2. Introduce `native/` as the renamed handwritten lane for current `pytra-core`.
3. Keep `pytra/` as a compatibility/public shim lane for now if needed, but do not treat it as the ownership source of truth.
4. Compare runtime coverage by `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>` and ignore extension multiplicity (`.h/.cpp` vs `.rs/.cs`) as a secondary detail.
5. Treat `generated/built_in/*` as the lane for `src/pytra/built_in/*.py`, while keeping substrate files such as `py_runtime.*` in `native/built_in/*`.

## Target Layout

Canonical `rs/cs` layout:

- `src/runtime/<lang>/generated/{built_in,std,utils}/`
  - generated from `src/pytra/**` only
- `src/runtime/<lang>/native/{built_in,std,utils}/`
  - handwritten runtime only
- `src/runtime/<lang>/pytra/{built_in,std,utils}/`
  - public shim / compatibility lane when needed

Notes:
- C++-specific `core/` and `.h/.cpp` pairing are not copied literally into every backend.
- The important part is to make ownership visible by lane/module, such as `generated/std/json`, `generated/utils/gif`, and `native/built_in/py_runtime`.

## Compare Unit

The canonical compare unit is `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>`, and extension differences or backend-specific header/source splits are excluded from comparison.

- lane:
  - `generated`
  - `native`
  - `pytra` (compat/public shim, not used for ownership decisions)
- bucket:
  - `built_in`
  - `std`
  - `utils`
  - `compiler`
- module examples:
  - `generated/utils/gif`
  - `generated/utils/png`
  - `native/built_in/py_runtime`
  - `native/std/json`

This compare unit is the basis for making `missing generated artifact` and `hand-written residual still in native` obvious from tree diffs alone.

Decision log:
- 2026-03-12: Per user direction, promoted the non-C++ runtime layout reset to P0 and fixed the rule that `generated/` may contain only SoT-emitted artifacts.
- 2026-03-12: Chose `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>` as the canonical compare unit instead of forcing literal C++ header/source duplication into every backend.
- 2026-03-12: Closed `S1-01/S1-02` by fixing the canonical `<lane>/<bucket>/<module>` compare unit and mapping the current `pytra-core/pytra-gen` trees for `rs/cs` onto the target `generated/native/pytra` layout. In the first wave, `pytra/**` remains the compat/public shim lane and is excluded from ownership decisions.
- 2026-03-12: Closed `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S2-01` / `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S2-02` / `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S2-03` by cutting the real `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/{native,generated}` trees over, syncing the Rust runtime hook, the C# build/selfhost/runtime paths, and the runtime guards / allowlists / inventories, then rerunning `tools/gen_runtime_from_manifest.py --targets rs,cs --items utils/png,utils/gif`.
- 2026-03-12: As the first probe for `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S3-01`, checked whether `json.py` / `pathlib.py` can already flow into `cs/rs` generated std lanes. `json.py` still stops on the `@abi` target restriction, while `pathlib.py` still lacks wired `os/os_path/glob` runtime import lanes, so the std-lane migration remains a follow-up wave.
- 2026-03-12: As a compare-lane expansion under `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01`, added `rs/cs` `std/{time,math,os,os_path,glob,pathlib}` entries to `tools/runtime_generation_manifest.json` and generated `src/runtime/{rs,cs}/generated/std/*` from SoT. For now these files exist to make tree-level comparison concrete; build/runtime hooks still stay on the `native` lane.
- 2026-03-12: Closed `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S3-01` by fixing the C# std lane ownership contract in `noncpp_runtime_layout_contract.py` / `check_noncpp_runtime_layout_contract.py`. The current decision is `json=native/std + generated blocked`, `pathlib=native/std canonical + generated compare artifact`, `math=native/built_in canonical + generated compare artifact`, and `re/argparse/enum=no runtime module`, guarded across the build profile, emitter alias lane, and C# smoke tests.
- 2026-03-12: Re-scoped this P0 to `rs/cs` only and moved the remaining backend rollout into a separate P1 task. `generated/built_in/*` is part of the mandatory P0 end state, not an optional later extra.
- 2026-03-12: Closed `P0-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ALIGN-01-S3-02-A` by adding the Rust std ownership baseline to `noncpp_runtime_layout_contract.py` / `check_noncpp_runtime_layout_contract.py`. The current decision is `time/math=native/built_in canonical + generated compare artifact`, `pathlib/os/os_path/glob=no live runtime module + generated compare artifact`, `json=generated blocked + no live runtime module`, and `re/argparse/enum=no runtime module`, guarded across the manifest, native scaffold, and Rust smoke tests.
