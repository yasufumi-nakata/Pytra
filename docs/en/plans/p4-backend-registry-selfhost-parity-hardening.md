# P4: Canonicalize Backend Registry Metadata and Strengthen Selfhost Parity Gates

Last updated: 2026-03-11

Related TODO:
- `ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01` in `docs/ja/todo/index.md`

Background:
- The host-side `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry.py` and the selfhost/static `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_static.py` still duplicate a large amount of backend spec, runtime-copy, emitter-wiring, and option-schema logic.
- That duplication was useful during bootstrap, but it now makes backend-surface updates drift-prone because one side can be updated without the other.
- Selfhost verification tools already exist: `build_selfhost.py`, `build_selfhost_stage2.py`, `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py`, `check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`, and related scripts. But operationally they still behave more like auxiliary reports than stable gates for compiler-internal changes.
- The current selfhost path also mixes direct routes, host-Python bridges, preview lanes, and known blocks, so it is often unclear which failures are expected and which are true regressions.
- Even if P2/P3 improve typed boundaries and compiler contracts, host-vs-selfhost divergence will reappear unless backend-registry ownership and selfhost parity gates are hardened too.

Goal:
- Establish one source of truth for backend spec, runtime-copy rules, layer option schema, and writer metadata, and reduce drift between host and selfhost/static registries.
- Turn selfhost parity from "useful information" into a practical non-regression gate for compiler-internal work.
- Classify stage1 / stage2 / direct-route / multilang selfhost failures so expected blocks and real regressions are easy to distinguish.

Scope:
- `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry.py`
- `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_static.py`
- Shared backend spec / runtime-copy / option-schema / writer metadata
- `tools/build_selfhost.py` / `build_selfhost_stage2.py` / `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py`
- `tools/check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`
- Selfhost parity docs / reports / guards

Out of scope:
- Typed-carrier design itself
- Fully removing the host-Python bridge
- Forcing every backend to succeed at multistage selfhost immediately
- Adding new backend language features
- A full runtime redesign

Dependencies:
- The boundary-ownership policy from `P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01` must be fixed
- The validator/diagnostic policy from `P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01` should exist at least for representative lanes

## Mandatory Rules

These are requirements, not recommendations.

1. Backend capability, runtime-copy, option-schema, and writer-rule metadata must have exactly one source of truth. Host/static manual duplication is not acceptable as the canonical design.
2. If host and selfhost/static registries behave differently, each difference must be identified as either intentional or drift. Hidden divergence is not allowed.
3. Selfhost parity failures must be categorized explicitly (`known_block`, `not_implemented`, `regression`, etc.). Vague preview text alone is not enough.
4. Representative stage1 / stage2 / direct-route / multilang selfhost gates must be runnable as part of routine compiler-internal regression checks.
5. Unsupported targets and unsupported modes should report the same diagnostic category in registry code and parity reports.
6. Any runtime-copy-list or backend-spec update must update both the shared source of truth and the parity/reporting side.
7. Selfhost parity does not need to mean "every backend passes everything," but it must always distinguish expected blocks from regressions.

Acceptance criteria:
- Backend spec / runtime-copy / option-schema / writer metadata is shared, and hand-written duplication between host/static registries is reduced.
- A drift guard or diff test exists to catch one-sided backend-registry updates.
- The selfhost parity suite reports representative stage1 / stage2 / direct e2e / multilang lanes with stable failure categories.
- For representative compiler changes, it is possible to tell which selfhost failures are known blocks and which are regressions.
- Docs / reports / archive make selfhost readiness and known blocks traceable.

Planned verification commands:
- `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py`
- `python3 tools/build_selfhost.py`
- `python3 tools/build_selfhost_stage2.py --skip-stage1-build`
- `python3 tools/verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py --skip-build`
- `python3 tools/check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`
- `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s test/unit/selfhost -p 'test_*selfhost*.py'`
- `git diff --check`

## Implementation Order

Keep the order fixed: inventory drift sources first, fix the canonical source of truth second, then strengthen the parity gates.

1. Inventory registry drift and parity blind spots
2. Fix canonical backend spec / runtime metadata
3. Share host/static registry ownership
4. Strengthen selfhost parity gates / reports / failure categories
5. Refresh docs / archive / migration notes

## Breakdown

- [x] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-01] Inventory duplicated surfaces across `backend_registry.py` and `backend_registry_static.py` (backend spec, runtime copy, writer rules, option schema, direct-route behavior), then classify each difference as intentional or drift-prone.
- [x] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-02] Inventory current gates and blind spots across `build_selfhost`, stage2, direct e2e verification, and multilang selfhost tools, then fix the known-block vs regression classification policy in the decision log.
- [x] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-01] Define the canonical source of truth for backend capability, runtime-copy rules, option schema, and writer metadata so both host and static registries can be derived from it.
- [x] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-02] Fix the boundaries where intentional differences are allowed (for example host-only lazy imports or selfhost-only direct routes) together with their diagnostic contracts.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-01] Move host/static registries toward shared metadata, a generator, or equivalent adapters and retire avoidable hand-written duplication.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-02] Add a registry-drift guard or diff test so one-sided backend-surface updates fail fast.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S4-01] Reorganize representative stage1 / stage2 / direct e2e / multilang selfhost parity suites so they report a stable shared summary and failure taxonomy.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S4-02] Align unsupported / preview / known-block / regression diagnostics between registry code and parity reports so expected failures are explicitly managed.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S5-01] Refresh docs / plan reports / archive so backend readiness, known blocks, and gate execution flow remain traceable.
- [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S5-02] Verify that representative internal changes are checked through equivalent contracts on both host and selfhost lanes, then fix reintroduction guards.

Decision log:
- 2026-03-09: Added this P4 in response to the user request to keep improving the compiler internals after the type/carrier work.
- 2026-03-09: Fixed the scope of this P4 to backend-registry source-of-truth cleanup and selfhost non-regression gates, not new backend language features.
- 2026-03-09: Fixed the policy that host/selfhost differences are not banned outright, but must always be classified as intentional differences or drift and tracked through guards/reports.
- 2026-03-11: For `P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-01`, the intentional-difference inventory was fixed to three surfaces only: lazy import on the host side (`importlib`, `_TARGET_LOADERS`, `_SPEC_CACHE`), eager import on the static side (`_BACKEND_SPECS`, `_BACKEND_RUNTIME_SPECS`), and the host/static split in `build_resolved_backend_spec(..., suppress_emit_exceptions=True/False)`.
- 2026-03-11: Drift candidates were classified into four groups: duplicated runtime-copy helpers (`_runtime_*`, `_copy_runtime_file`, `_copy_php_runtime`), backend metadata tables (`target_lang`, `extension`, `lower/optimizer/emit`, `runtime_hook`, and C++ `default_options` / `option_schema`), emit-wrapper duplication (host `_load_*_spec` / `_make_unary_emit` versus static `_emit_*`), and default-writer injection (lazy `_load_callable(...)` versus direct `write_single_file_program`).
- 2026-03-11: The execution surface itself (`resolve_layer_options_*`, `lower_ir_*`, `optimize_ir_*`, `emit_module_*`, `emit_source_*`, `get_program_writer_*`, `apply_runtime_hook_*`) is already largely shared through `typed_boundary` helpers, so P4 should focus on unifying backend-metadata construction and runtime/report paths rather than reworking the execute path again.
- 2026-03-11: For `P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-02`, the blind-spot inventory fixed that `build_selfhost.py` is a fail-fast stage-boundary preflight + transpile + compile gate with no category output, `build_selfhost_stage2.py` only special-cases `[not_implemented]` fallback reuse, and `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py` collapses direct-route parity into plain `[FAIL ...]` buckets plus `failures=N` with no expected-block category.
- 2026-03-11: The same inventory fixed that `check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py` expresses preview/toolchain-missing only through `stage1/mode/stage2/note` without a category column, while `check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py` already has a `category` column but `check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py` does not unify that category surface with stage1 or direct-route lanes.
- 2026-03-11: The classification policy was fixed so selfhost parity reporting must normalize at least `pass`, `known_block`, `preview_only`, `toolchain_missing`, `not_implemented`, and `regression`; build-only gates may still return raw exit codes internally, but the report layer must map them into the same category set.
- 2026-03-11: Representative gate ownership was fixed as: `build_selfhost.py` for stage1 preflight build, `build_selfhost_stage2.py` and `check_selfhost_stage2_cpp_diff.py` for stage2 build/drift, `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py` for direct-route parity, and `check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py` for multilang readiness summary. S4 should unify summary format and failure categories along those boundaries.
- 2026-03-11: `P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-02` fixed the representative gate inventory to four lanes: `build_selfhost.py` as the C++ stage1 build gate, `build_selfhost_stage2.py` plus `check_selfhost_stage2_cpp_diff.py` as the C++ stage2/self-diff gate, `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py` as the C++ direct-route stdout-parity gate, and `check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py` / `check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py` as the non-C++ parity-report gate.
- 2026-03-11: Blind spots were classified into four groups: `build_selfhost.py` / `build_selfhost_stage2.py` still rely on raw exit codes and fallback warnings instead of structured categories; `verify_selfhost_end_to_end.py` is biased toward stdout parity on a small fixed case list and lacks artifact-diff and failure-taxonomy output; `check_selfhost_cpp_diff.py` and direct-route lanes still externalize expected blocks through modes such as `allow-not-implemented`; and the multilang suite already has categories like `preview_only` / `toolchain_missing` / `self_retranspile_fail`, but its summary vocabulary is not aligned with the C++ lane yet.
- 2026-03-11: Future parity reports should use `pass`, `known_block`, `toolchain_missing`, and `regression` as top-level categories, while preserving detail categories such as `preview_only`, `not_implemented`, `unsupported_by_design`, `self_retranspile_fail`, `stage2_compile_fail`, `sample_transpile_fail`, and `direct_parity_fail`. Intentional blocks normalize to `known_block`; failures on previously passing representative lanes, unexpected fallback, artifact/stdout diffs, and missing outputs are treated as `regression`.
- 2026-03-11: As the first `P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-01` slice, `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_metadata.py` was added to hold shared backend target order, `target_lang` / `extension` / `runtime_mode` / `program_writer_kind`, and the C++ `default_options` / `option_schema` rows.
- 2026-03-11: Host `_load_*_spec()` and static `_BACKEND_SPECS` now derive backend spec rows through `build_backend_spec_row(...)`. This removes duplicated metadata tables, but runtime-copy function bodies and emit/runtime callable wiring are still separate host/static implementations, so S2-01 remains open and those seams stay in scope for S3-01 sharing.
- 2026-03-11: The next `S2-01` slice expanded the shared metadata from plain rows to canonical `lower_ref` / `optimizer_ref` / `emit_ref` / `emit_kind` / `runtime_hook_key` / `program_writer_key` fields plus runtime file descriptors. The host registry now keeps lazy imports while deriving `_load_backend_spec(target)` from that canonical metadata, and the static registry now resolves the same descriptors through `_build_backend_spec(target)` and `_STATIC_CALLABLES`. The remaining intentional differences are eager-vs-lazy import/evaluation and `suppress_emit_exceptions=True/False`.
- 2026-03-11: `S2-01` is now considered complete. The canonical source of truth lives in `backend_registry_metadata.py`, and both host/static registries derive backend target order, spec metadata rows, lower/optimizer/emit refs, runtime-hook descriptors, and program-writer refs from it. The next step is to pin the intentional-difference and diagnostics contract in `S2-02`.
- 2026-03-11: As the first `S2-02` contract, the only intentional host/static differences are now fixed to lazy import via `importlib + _SPEC_CACHE`, eager resolve via `_STATIC_CALLABLES + _BACKEND_RUNTIME_SPECS`, and `suppress_emit_exceptions=True/False`. Unsupported targets must still report the same `RuntimeError("unsupported target: ...")` on both lanes, while runtime-hook / program-writer / emit-ref mismatches are allowed to surface as canonical metadata key/ref resolution errors.
- 2026-03-11: The next `S2-02` slice also fixed the diagnostics contract itself: host-side backend symbol-ref failures are now normalized to the same `RuntimeError("unsupported backend symbol ref: ...")` used by the static lane, and runtime-hook keys, program-writer keys, and backend symbol refs must all surface the same canonical error text across both lanes.
- 2026-03-11: As part of the `S2-02` diagnostics contract, tests now pin canonical metadata failures for unknown `runtime_hook_key` / `program_writer_key` to `RuntimeError("unsupported ... key: ...")`. Registry layers are expected to expose those metadata errors directly instead of hiding them behind fallback behavior.
- 2026-03-11: Another `S2-02` slice also pins kind-level diagnostics: if metadata descriptors are corrupted so the resolved `runtime_hook kind` or `emit kind` becomes invalid, both host and static lanes must still raise the same `RuntimeError("unsupported ... kind: ...")`. These diagnostics are treated as shared contract outside the intentional eager-vs-lazy difference.
- 2026-03-11: `S2-02` is now considered complete. The only intentional differences are lazy import vs eager resolve and `suppress_emit_exceptions`, while unsupported target / metadata key / backend symbol ref / kind-level diagnostics are all locked to the same canonical error text across host and static lanes.
- 2026-03-11: As the first `S3-01` slice, the fully duplicated runtime-copy helpers, php-runtime copy helpers, default output-path helper, and no-op runtime hook were moved into `toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_shared.py`. The remaining intentional difference is the lazy-vs-eager callable resolution path; pure helper duplication should now collapse into shared modules.
