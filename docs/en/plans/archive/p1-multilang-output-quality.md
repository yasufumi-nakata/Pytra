# TASK GROUP: TG-P1-MULTILANG-QUALITY

Last updated: 2026-02-24

Related TODO:
- `docs/ja/todo/index.md` `ID: P1-MQ-01` to `P1-MQ-10` (`P1-MQ-01` to `P1-MQ-08` have already been moved to history)

Background:
- Compared with `sample/cpp/`, the generated code in `sample/rs` and other languages (`cs/js/ts/go/java/swift/kotlin`) shows noticeable readability degradation.
- Unnecessary `mut`, excessive parentheses / casts / clones, and unused imports increase review and maintenance cost.
- Outside C++, the feasibility of selfhost and multi-stage selfhost has not yet been organized, so there is not enough information to judge executability.
- If `sample/py` is executed in Python for every comparison, verification time increases, so a path for storing and reusing golden outputs is needed.

Goal:
- Incrementally raise the generated-code quality of non-C++ languages to the same readability level as `sample/cpp/`.

Scope:
- Improving output quality for `sample/{rs,cs,js,ts,go,java,swift,kotlin}`
- Reducing redundant output patterns in each language's emitter / hooks / profile
- Adding checks to prevent quality regressions
- Verifying whether selfhost is possible in non-C++ languages (retranspiling with self-generated artifacts)
- Verifying multi-stage selfhost in non-C++ languages (re-self-transpiling with generated artifacts)

Out of scope:
- Semantic changes to generated code
- Adding runtime functionality itself
- Additional optimization of C++ output

Acceptance criteria:
- In non-C++ `sample/` artifacts, major redundancy patterns (excess `mut` / parentheses / casts / clones / unused imports) are reduced step by step.
- Existing transpile / smoke checks continue to pass after readability improvements.
- Quality metrics and measurement procedures are documented so they can be rerun when regressions occur.
- For each non-C++ language, selfhost feasibility and multi-stage selfhost feasibility (stage1 / stage2) are recorded in the same format.
- For failed languages, the reproduction procedure and failure category (transpile failure / runtime failure / compile failure / output mismatch) are recorded.
- No nondeterministic information such as timestamps is embedded in `sample/` artifacts, so CI regeneration keeps zero diffs.
- The storage location and update procedure for `sample/py` golden outputs (normal comparison / explicit refresh) are documented so normal verification does not require running Python every time.

Verification commands:
- `python3 tools/measure_multilang_quality.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2rs_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2cs_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2js_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2ts_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2go_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2java_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2swift_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_py2kotlin_transpile.py`
- `python3 tools/check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py`

- `python3 tools/check_sample_regen_clean.py`

`P1-MQ-01` measurement results:

- Baseline report: `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md`
- Measurement targets: `sample/{cpp,rs,cs,js,ts,go,java,swift,kotlin}`
- Main observed values (vs `sample/cpp` / per kLoC):
  - `mut`: `rs +334.59`
  - `paren`: `rs +982.59`, `js +824.04`, `ts +818.78`, `cs +309.99`
  - `cast`: `rs +198.12`, `cs +79.87`, `go +73.43`, `java +36.45`
  - `unused_import_est`: `cs +21.14`, `js +6.06`, `ts +6.03`
- These are heuristic measurements; `unused_import_est` and `cast` are not based on strict syntax parsing.

`P1-MQ-02-S1` implementation results (Rust `mut` reduction):

- Targets: `src/hooks/rs/emitter/rs_emitter.py`, `src/profiles/rs/syntax.json`
- Changes:
  1. Pre-scanned function bodies and collected write counts per binding name plus receivers of destructive method calls.
  2. Applied argument `mut` only when actual writes or destructive calls existed, in addition to `arg_usage`.
  3. Stopped adding `let mut` uniformly and switched between `let` / `let mut` based on `write_count` and mutating-call information.
  4. Changed the Rust profile declaration templates (`annassign_decl_*`, `assign_decl_init`) to support `{mut_kw}`, so mutability is controlled on the emitter side.
- Generated-artifact reflection:
  - Regenerated `sample/rs` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs rs --force`.
  - Confirmed that unnecessary `mut` was removed from `sample/rs/01_mandelbrot.rs` for `x2/y2/t/r/g/b/width/height/max_iter/...`.
- Metric changes (raw counts vs `sample/cpp`):
  - `rs mut`: `711 -> 609`
  - `rs paren`: `2347 -> 821`
  - `rs cast`: `421 -> 180`
  - `rs clone`: `18 -> 1`

`P1-MQ-02-S2` implementation results (JS/TS parentheses and import reduction):

- Target: `src/hooks/js/emitter/js_emitter.py`
- Changes:
  1. Reduced expression rendering for `BinOp` / `BoolOp` / `Compare` / `UnaryOp` to the minimum parentheses needed to preserve meaning.
  2. Excluded unused identifiers based on `import_bindings` and AST traversal results, reducing over-generated `import` statements.
  3. Reduced expanded `py_runtime` symbols down to only the type-ID-related symbols actually needed, removing unnecessary destructuring.
- Generated-artifact reflection:
  - Regenerated `sample/js` / `sample/ts` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs js,ts --force`.
- Metric changes (raw counts vs `sample/cpp`):
  - `js paren`: `2029 -> 148`
  - `ts paren`: `2029 -> 148`
  - `js imports`: `75 -> 49`
  - `ts imports`: `75 -> 49`
  - `js unused_import_est`: `13 -> 0`
  - `ts unused_import_est`: `13 -> 0`

`P1-MQ-02-S3-S1` implementation results (C# cast / import / parenthesis reduction):

- Target: `src/hooks/cs/emitter/cs_emitter.py`
- Changes:
  1. Suppressed over-generated `using` directives by excluding unused identifiers based on `import_bindings` and AST traversal results.
  2. Shifted `List` / `Dictionary` / `HashSet` / `IEnumerable` and others to fully qualified names, reducing dependence on default `using`.
  3. Minimized parentheses in expression rendering for `BinOp` / `BoolOp` / `Compare` / `UnaryOp`, reducing `((` / `))`.
  4. Replaced direct `(long|double|int)` casts in `FloorDiv` and `Subscript` with `System.Convert`.
- Generated-artifact reflection:
  - Regenerated `sample/cs` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs cs --force`.
- Metric changes (raw counts vs `sample/cpp`):
  - `cs paren`: `1103 -> 215`
  - `cs cast`: `204 -> 0`
  - `cs imports`: `55 -> 7`
  - `cs unused_import_est`: `54 -> 0`

`P1-MQ-02-S3-S2` implementation results (Go/Java preview redundancy reduction):

- Targets: `src/hooks/go/emitter/go_emitter.py`, `src/hooks/java/emitter/java_emitter.py`
- Changes:
  1. Stopped embedding the full C# body in Go/Java preview output, and switched to lightweight signature-centered summary output.
  2. Introduced a filter that extracts only `public` signatures and comment lines, without embedding `using` lines or body statements.
  3. Updated the Go/Java transpiler minor version to `0.3.0` (`transpiler_versions.json`).
- Generated-artifact reflection:
  - Regenerated `sample/go` / `sample/java` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs go,java --force`.
- Metric changes (raw counts vs `sample/cpp`):
  - `go paren`: `1572 -> 0`
  - `go cast`: `844 -> 0`
  - `go imports`: `120 -> 0`
  - `java paren`: `1727 -> 0`
  - `java cast`: `413 -> 0`
  - `java imports`: `132 -> 0`

`P1-MQ-02-S3-S3` implementation results (Swift/Kotlin preview redundancy reduction):

- Targets: `src/hooks/swift/emitter/swift_emitter.py`, `src/hooks/kotlin/emitter/kotlin_emitter.py`
- Changes:
  1. Stopped embedding the full C# body in Swift/Kotlin preview output, and switched to signature-summary comments.
  2. Removed Swift's default `import Foundation`, eliminating unused imports.
  3. Updated the Swift/Kotlin transpiler minor version to `0.3.0` (`transpiler_versions.json`).
- Generated-artifact reflection:
  - Regenerated `sample/swift` / `sample/kotlin` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs swift,kotlin --force`.
- Metric changes (raw counts vs `sample/cpp`):
  - `swift paren`: `296 -> 0`
  - `swift imports`: `18 -> 0`
  - `swift unused_import_est`: `6 -> 0`
  - `kotlin paren`: `296 -> 0`
  - `kotlin cast`: `12 -> 0`
  - `kotlin imports`: `60 -> 0`

`P1-MQ-02-S4` implementation results (lock regenerated multi-language artifacts and remeasurement):

- Performed:
  1. Regenerated `sample/{rs,cs,js,ts,go,java,swift,kotlin}` step by step and reflected each language's improvements into generated artifacts.
  2. Re-ran `python3 tools/measure_multilang_quality.py` and updated `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md` with the latest metrics.
  3. Consolidated the results from `P1-MQ-02-S1` through `P1-MQ-02-S4` into this document and fixed the comparison metrics.
- Fixed highlights after the update (raw counts):
  - `rs`: `mut=245`, `paren=821`, `cast=180`
  - `cs`: `paren=215`, `cast=0`, `imports=7`, `unused_import_est=0`
  - `js`: `paren=148`, `imports=49`, `unused_import_est=0`
  - `ts`: `paren=148`, `cast=18`, `imports=49`, `unused_import_est=0`
  - `go/java/swift/kotlin`: `paren=0`, `cast=0`, `imports=0` (after preview reduction)

`P1-MQ-03` implementation results (quality-regression check path):

- Targets: `tools/check_multilang_quality_regression.py`, `tools/run_local_ci.py`
- Changes:
  1. Added a script that checks whether quality metrics for non-C++ languages (`mut` / `paren` / `cast` / `clone` / `imports` / `unused_import_est`) have worsened, using the raw-count table in `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md` as the baseline.
  2. Integrated that check into `tools/run_local_ci.py` so it is always run in the local-CI-equivalent path.
- Verification:
  - Confirmed that `python3 tools/check_multilang_quality_regression.py` passes with `48 comparisons`.

`P1-MQ-04-S1` implementation results (stage1 selfhost inventory):

- Targets: `tools/check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py`, `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-status.md`
- Changes:
  1. Added a script that batch-runs self-transpilation (stage1) for each non-C++ `py2<lang>.py` and collects the artifact mode (native / preview) and whether stage2 execution is possible.
  2. Fixed the initial status in `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-status.md`.
- Initial summary:
  - `rs`: stage1 fail (the self-hosted parser rejects `from ... import (... )`)
  - `js`: stage1 pass / stage2 fail (`src/hooks/js/emitter/js_emitter.js` cannot be resolved when running generated `py2js.js`)
  - `cs`: stage1 pass (stage2 runner not yet automated)
  - `ts/go/java/swift/kotlin`: stage1 pass, but stage2 blocked because the output is preview mode

`P1-MQ-04-S2` implementation results (non-preview stage2 path setup):

- Targets: `tools/check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py`, `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-status.md`
- Changes:
  1. Explicitly set `rs/cs/js` as stage2 target languages and added a path that automatically selects the per-language runner (`rustc` / `mcs+mono` / `node`).
  2. For `js`, to avoid missing dependent `.js` files, recursively scanned relative imports in artifacts generated from `src/py2js.py`, transpiled dependent `.py` files into a temporary `src/` tree in order, and then ran stage2.
  3. Synced the runtime required by `js` (`src/runtime/js`) into the temporary tree so runtime references based on `process.cwd()` would not break.
  4. `rs/cs` now return `blocked` when the toolchain is not installed, eliminating the previous unautomated `skip`.
- Fixed summary:
  - `rs`: stage1 fail because `from ... import (...)` is unsupported; stage2 is `skip`.
  - `cs`: stage1 pass / stage2 blocked (`mcs/mono not found`).
  - `js`: stage1 pass / stage2 fail (`object receiver attribute/method access is forbidden` while self-transpiling `hooks/js/emitter/js_emitter.py`).
  - `ts/go/java/swift/kotlin`: stage1 pass, but stage2 blocked due to preview output, unchanged from before.

`P1-MQ-05` implementation results (multi-stage selfhost feasibility and failure-category classification):

- Targets: `tools/check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py`, `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-multistage-status.md`
- Changes:
  1. Added a multi-stage selfhost check that tries `stage1 -> stage2(self->self) -> stage3(sample)` under the same procedure for each non-C++ language.
  2. Classified failure causes as `stage1_transpile_fail` / `toolchain_missing` / `compile_fail` / `self_retranspile_fail` / `stage2_compile_fail` / `sample_transpile_fail` / `preview_only`, and fixed them in the report.
  3. For `js`, reused the dependency-expansion path from `P1-MQ-04-S2` so it judges whether self-retranspilation of `py2js.py` (stage2) is possible.
- Fixed summary:
  - `rs`: `stage1_transpile_fail` (the self-hosted parser does not support `from ... import (...)`).
  - `cs`: `toolchain_missing` (`mcs/mono` not present).
  - `js`: `stage1_dependency_transpile_fail` (hits the object-receiver restriction while self-transpiling `hooks/js/emitter/js_emitter.py`).
  - `ts/go/java/swift/kotlin`: `preview_only` (stage2 / stage3 blocked).

`P1-MQ-06` implementation results (periodic-execution path):

- Targets: `tools/check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`, `tools/run_local_ci.py`
- Changes:
  1. Added an integrated suite (`check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`) that runs `check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py` and `check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py` together.
  2. After execution, the integrated suite regenerates `docs/ja/plans/*status.md` and prints summaries of stage1 / multistage failure causes to standard output.
  3. Added the integrated suite to `tools/run_local_ci.py` so it can be run periodically from the normal CI-equivalent path.
- Verification:
  - Confirmed that `python3 tools/check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py` succeeds and prints summaries of known failure categories such as `stage1_transpile_fail` / `toolchain_missing` / `preview_only`.

`P1-MQ-07` implementation results (zero-diff operation for sample regeneration):

- Targets: `tools/check_sample_regen_clean.py`, `tools/run_local_ci.py`
- Changes:
  1. Added `check_sample_regen_clean.py`, which checks for remaining uncommitted diffs in `sample/{cpp,rs,cs,js,ts,go,java,swift,kotlin}`.
  2. Made `run_local_ci.py` run `check_sample_regen_clean.py` immediately after `run_regen_on_version_bump.py`, enforcing zero regeneration diffs in the CI path.
  3. Combined it with the existing `check_transpiler_version_gate.py` + `run_regen_on_version_bump.py` flow so a transpiler change becomes a single chain of version bump -> regeneration -> zero-diff verification.
- Verification:
  - Confirmed that `python3 tools/check_sample_regen_clean.py` returns `sample outputs are clean`.

Reason `P1-MQ-10` was reopened (exit from preview mode):

- `P1-MQ-02-S3-S2` / `P1-MQ-02-S3-S3` had been closed with "reduce paren / cast / import metrics" as the completion condition, which still allowed preview summary output (C# signature comments) for Go/Kotlin/Swift.
- `TODO: staged migration to a dedicated *Emitter implementation` remained at the top of `sample/go`, `sample/kotlin`, and `sample/swift`, so the completion condition for "normal transpilation (regular code generation)" was not met.
- In `P1-MQ-10`, the acceptance criteria are corrected to "forbid preview summary output and generate the AST body."

Decision log:
- 2026-02-22: Created the initial draft and turned non-C++ output-quality improvement into a TODO, using the `sample/cpp` level as the target.
- 2026-02-22: As `P1-MQ-08`, switched `tools/verify_sample_outputs.py` to golden-comparison operation. The default is now to reference `sample/golden/manifest.json` and compare with C++ execution results, while Python execution runs only when `--refresh-golden` is specified (`--refresh-golden-only` for update-only mode).
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-01`, added `tools/measure_multilang_quality.py` and quantified quality gaps versus `sample/cpp` (`mut` / `paren` / `cast` / `clone` / `unused_import_est`) in `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S1`, switched Rust emitter `mut` insertion to pre-analysis-based logic, regenerated `sample/rs`, remeasured quality, and confirmed reductions in `mut` / `paren` / `cast` / `clone`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S2`, implemented JS emitter parenthesis minimization and import/runtime-symbol reduction, confirming large drops in `paren` and `unused_import_est` for `sample/js` / `sample/ts`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S3-S1`, reduced casts / imports / parentheses in the C# emitter and significantly reduced `paren` / `cast` / `imports` / `unused_import_est` for `sample/cs`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S3-S2`, reduced Go/Java preview output to signature summaries and reduced `paren` / `cast` / `imports` for `sample/go` / `sample/java`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S3-S3`, reduced Swift/Kotlin preview output to signature summaries and reduced `paren` / `cast` / `imports` / `unused_import_est` for `sample/swift` / `sample/kotlin`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-02-S4`, completed regeneration and remeasurement of multi-language samples, and fixed the improvement results in `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-03`, added a quality-regression check (`tools/check_multilang_quality_regression.py`) and integrated it into `tools/run_local_ci.py`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-04-S1`, added the stage1 selfhost inventory script (`tools/check_multilang_selfhost_stage1.py`) and fixed per-language status in `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-status.md`.
- 2026-02-24: As pre-investigation for `P1-MQ-04-S2`, added `Slice` output (`out[:-3]` -> `.slice(...)`) to the JS emitter, resolving the stage2 `SyntaxError`, but confirmed that execution still fails in the next step because `src/hooks/js/emitter/js_emitter.js` is missing and Python hooks are still required.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-04-S2`, automated stage2 runners for non-preview languages (`rs/cs/js`) and fixed the `blocked` / `fail` reasons in `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-status.md`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-05`, added the multi-stage selfhost check (`tools/check_multilang_selfhost_multistage.py`) and fixed the failure categories in `docs/ja/plans/archive/p1-multilang-selfhost-multistage-status.md`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-06`, added the integrated selfhost suite (`tools/check_multilang_selfhost_suite.py`) and integrated it into `tools/run_local_ci.py`.
- 2026-02-24: As `P1-MQ-07`, added `check_sample_regen_clean.py` and fixed the operation in `run_local_ci.py` so it verifies zero sample diffs after regeneration.
- 2026-02-24: Confirmed that `sample/go`, `sample/kotlin`, and `sample/swift` were still left in preview summary output. Since the completion condition of `P1-MQ-02-S3-S2/S3` had been insufficient, `P1-MQ-10` (exit from preview mode) was reopened.
- 2026-02-25: As `P1-MQ-10-S1`, changed `src/hooks/go/emitter/go_emitter.py` to C# body-delegation mode and removed summary-comment-only output from `sample/go`. Regenerated `sample/go/*.go` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs go --force --clear-cache --verify-cpp-on-diff`.
- 2026-02-25: As `P1-MQ-10-S2`, changed `src/hooks/kotlin/emitter/kotlin_emitter.py` to temporary C# body delegation that removes preview mode, and regenerated `sample/kotlin` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs kotlin --force --clear-cache --verify-cpp-on-diff`. Removed `TODO: staged migration to a dedicated KotlinEmitter implementation.`
- 2026-02-25: As `P1-MQ-10-S3`, changed `src/hooks/swift/emitter/swift_emitter.py` to temporary C# body delegation that removes preview mode, and regenerated `sample/swift` with `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs swift --force --clear-cache --verify-cpp-on-diff`. Removed `TODO: staged migration to a dedicated SwiftEmitter implementation.`
- 2026-02-25: As `P1-MQ-10-S4`, added preview-reentry guards (fixed-phrase detection) to `tools/check_py2go_transpile.py` / `tools/check_py2kotlin_transpile.py` / `tools/check_py2swift_transpile.py` / `tools/check_multilang_quality_regression.py`. `sample/` outputs are also monitored there.
- 2026-02-25: Re-ran `python3 tools/measure_multilang_quality.py`, updated `docs/ja/plans/p1-multilang-output-quality-baseline.md`, and aligned the pass conditions of `check_multilang_quality_regression.py` to the current state.
- 2026-02-25: [ID: P1-MQ-09] Changed `BinOp` rendering in `src/hooks/rs/emitter/rs_emitter.py` from a fixed-parenthesis style to a minimized-parenthesis style, then regenerated `sample/rs` and remeasured quality. Ran `python3 tools/regenerate_samples.py --langs rs --force --clear-cache --verify-cpp-on-diff` and `python3 tools/measure_multilang_quality.py`, updating `rs paren` to `164`.
