# P5 Backend Feature Parity Contract

Last updated: 2026-03-12

Purpose:
- Stop treating C++ as the de facto feature-spec implementation and instead fix a cross-backend feature contract for syntax, builtins, and `pytra.std.*`.
- Ensure unsupported backend lanes fail closed instead of degrading via silent fallback or ad-hoc behavior.
- Create the feature inventory that later conformance suites, support matrices, and rollout policy will depend on.

Background:
- Pytra currently tends to advance through a representative C++ lane first, which makes feature handling uneven across Rust, C#, and other backends.
- `py_runtime.h` shrink work is more urgent in the short term, but backend parity still needs a fixed policy afterward rather than another round of “catch up later.”
- If parity remains a follow-up task only, C++-only implementations and object/String fallback behavior will drift back in.
- Fixing feature IDs, support states, and fail-closed rules first lets the project tolerate backend progress differences without losing the specification baseline.

Out of scope:
- Immediately implementing every feature in every backend.
- A full rewrite of `pytra.std.*`.
- Immediate `py_runtime.h` shrink work.
- Final cleanup of every backend runtime implementation detail.

Acceptance criteria:
- There is a defined plan for inventorying syntax, builtins, and `pytra.std.*` by feature ID.
- Backend support-state categories such as `supported`, `fail_closed`, `not_started`, and `experimental` are fixed.
- Unsupported backends are explicitly required to stop with `unsupported_syntax` / `not_implemented` style diagnostics instead of silently degrading.
- New-feature acceptance rules are defined so “C++ works” does not mean “feature complete.”
- The `docs/en/` mirror matches the Japanese source plan.

## Child tasks

- [x] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01-S1-01] Inventory representative syntax / builtin / `pytra.std.*` features by feature ID and fix the category and naming rules.
- [x] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01-S1-02] Fix backend support-state categories (`supported` / `fail_closed` / `not_started` / `experimental`) and the conditions for each.
- [x] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01-S2-01] Define fail-closed policy and diagnostic categories for unsupported backend lanes and forbid silent fallback.
- [x] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01-S2-02] Define the acceptance rule for new features so the project does not treat “works in C++ only” as completion.
- [x] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01-S3-01] Prepare the representative inventory document/tooling handoff so later conformance-suite and support-matrix work can attach cleanly.

## S1-01 Representative Inventory

- source of truth: [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- validation: [check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py), [test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/test/unit/tooling/test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- category rule:
  - `syntax`: `syntax.<area>.<feature>`
  - `builtin`: `builtin.<domain>.<feature>`
  - `stdlib`: `stdlib.<module>.<feature>`
- The representative inventory is not an exhaustive catalog; it is the fixed representative feature set that later conformance and support-matrix work will attach to.
- `syntax` representative:
  - `syntax.assign.tuple_destructure`
  - `syntax.expr.lambda`
  - `syntax.expr.list_comprehension`
  - `syntax.control.for_range`
  - `syntax.control.try_raise`
  - `syntax.oop.virtual_dispatch`
- `builtin` representative:
  - `builtin.iter.range`
  - `builtin.iter.enumerate`
  - `builtin.iter.zip`
  - `builtin.type.isinstance`
  - `builtin.bit.invert_and_mask`
- `stdlib` representative:
  - `stdlib.json.loads_dumps`
  - `stdlib.pathlib.path_ops`
  - `stdlib.enum.enum_and_intflag`
  - `stdlib.argparse.parse_args`
  - `stdlib.math.imported_symbols`
  - `stdlib.re.sub`

## S1-02 Support-state Taxonomy

- source of truth: [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- validation: [check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py), [test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/test/unit/tooling/test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- support states:
  - `supported`: the representative fixture / regression lane passes on the backend without preview-only caveats.
  - `fail_closed`: the feature is not implemented, but the backend stops with an explicit `unsupported_syntax` / `not_implemented` style diagnostic instead of silently degrading.
  - `not_started`: there is neither a representative implementation nor a fail-closed lane yet, so parity summaries must not claim support.
  - `experimental`: a preview-only or opt-in lane exists, but it is not yet counted as stable support.

## S2-01 Fail-closed Policy

- source of truth: [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- diagnostics vocabulary anchor: [backend_registry_diagnostics.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_registry_diagnostics.py)
- accepted fail-closed detail categories:
  - `not_implemented`
  - `unsupported_by_design`
  - `preview_only`
  - `blocked`
- forbidden silent fallback labels:
  - `object_fallback`
  - `string_fallback`
  - `comment_stub_fallback`
  - `empty_output_fallback`
- phase rules:
  - `parse_and_ir`: unsupported syntax / frontend lanes stop before emit.
  - `emit_and_runtime`: unsupported backend lanes stop with known-block diagnostics instead of degrading into object/String/comment fallback output.
  - `preview_rollout`: preview-only lanes remain `experimental` until explicitly promoted.

## S2-02 New-feature Acceptance Rule

- source of truth: [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- validation: [check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py), [test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/test/unit/tooling/test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- fixed acceptance rules:
  - `feature_id_required`: a new feature must have a feature ID unless it is explicitly declared out of representative scope.
  - `inventory_or_followup_required`: a representative fixture entry or a parity follow-up task must exist before merge.
  - `cxx_only_not_complete`: C++ support alone does not close the feature contract.
  - `noncpp_state_required`: at least one non-C++ backend support state must be recorded at merge time.
  - `unsupported_lanes_fail_closed`: any lane not marked `supported` must be `fail_closed`, `not_started`, or `experimental`, without silent fallback.
  - `docs_mirror_required`: parity-contract updates must update the `docs/en` mirror in the same change.

## S3-01 Representative Handoff

- source of truth: [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py)
- export seam: [export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py)
- validation: [check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/tools/check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py), [test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/test/unit/tooling/test_check_backend_feature_contract_inventory.py), [test_export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py](/workspace/Pytra/test/unit/tooling/test_export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py)
- P6 conformance handoff:
  - exported inventory: `iter_representative_conformance_handoff()`
  - downstream task: `P6-BACKEND-CONFORMANCE-SUITE-01`
  - fixed representative backends: `cpp`, `rs`, `cs`
  - fixed lane order: `parse`, `east`, `east3_lowering`, `emit`, `runtime`
- P7 support-matrix handoff:
  - exported inventory: `iter_representative_support_matrix_handoff()`
  - downstream task: `P7-BACKEND-PARITY-ROLLOUT-MATRIX-01`
  - fixed backend order: `cpp`, `rs`, `cs`, `go`, `java`, `kt`, `scala`, `swift`, `nim`, `js`, `ts`, `lua`, `rb`, `php`
  - fixed support-state order: `supported`, `fail_closed`, `not_started`, `experimental`
- docs/tooling handoff rule:
  - P6/P7 attach to the explicit handoff exports instead of re-interpreting `REPRESENTATIVE_FEATURE_INVENTORY` ad hoc.
  - P5 keeps ownership of fixture/category/state taxonomy, while later tasks focus on conformance results and support-matrix publication.
  - Downstream CLI/export flows must use `build_feature_contract_handoff_manifest()` / `export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py` instead of inventing another ad-hoc export format.

## Decision log

- 2026-03-12: Backend parity matters, but it should not block the near-term `P0-P4` `py_runtime.h` shrink work, so it is tracked as `P5`.
- 2026-03-12: The parity source of truth is the feature contract / EAST3 contract / `pytra.std.*` contract, not the C++ implementation.
- 2026-03-12: `S1-01` fixes the representative inventory source of truth in [backend_feature_contract_inventory.py](/workspace/Pytra/src/toolchain/compiler/backend_feature_contract_inventory.py) and freezes the category set at `syntax` / `builtin` / `stdlib`.
- 2026-03-12: `S1-02` fixes the backend support-state taxonomy at `supported` / `fail_closed` / `not_started` / `experimental`, and `fail_closed` is treated as an explicit parity-summary state rather than an implicit note.
- 2026-03-12: `S2-01` fixes unsupported backend diagnostics to `not_implemented` / `unsupported_by_design` / `preview_only` / `blocked`, and treats object/String/comment/empty-output fallback as forbidden silent fallback behavior.
- 2026-03-12: `S2-02` fixes merge acceptance rules so a passing C++ lane does not count as feature completion unless non-C++ state and docs-mirror updates are also recorded.
- 2026-03-12: `S3-01` adds explicit handoff exports for P6/P7 so conformance and matrix work can attach to a stable contract instead of re-deriving feature scope.
- 2026-03-12: `S3-01` also fixed the CLI/export seam through `build_feature_contract_handoff_manifest()` and `export_backend_feature_contract_manifest.py`.
