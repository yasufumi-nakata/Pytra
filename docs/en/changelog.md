# Changelog

## 2026-03-28

- **Go exception handling completed (P0-EXCEPTION-GO)**: Typed catch, accurate catch/rethrow for custom exceptions, `raise ... from ...`, bare rethrow, and union-return vertical slice implemented. Builtin exceptions consolidated into `pytra.built_in.error`.
- **C++ native exception lowering (P0-EXCEPTION-CPP)**: Native exception lowering implemented for the C++ backend.
- **Go selfhost progress (P2-SELFHOST)**: Lowering profile support, reference wrapper default for container locals, `yields_dynamic`-based type assertion, Go mapping dispatch + parity coverage completed. P2-LOWERING-PROFILE-GO completed.
- **CommonRenderer extensions**: elif chain rendering moved to common renderer. C++ common renderer parity regressions fixed.
- **type_id table linker generation (P0-TYPE-ID-TABLE)**: Spec and implementation for linker-generated `pytra.built_in.type_id_table`. Hardcoded type_id deprecation policy finalized.
- **@runtime / @extern decorator design completed (P0-RUNTIME-DECORATOR)**: Unified to `@runtime("namespace")` + `@extern` + `runtime_var("namespace")`. Auto-derivation rules, `symbol=` / `tag=` optional overrides, and include file structure specified in spec-runtime-decorator.md. Legacy `@extern_method` / `@abi` abolished.
- **P0-CPP-INCLUDE-PATH-FIX**: Fixed runtime include path inconsistency in C++ emitter.
- **P0-GO-PATHLIB-FIX**: Fixed Go emitter pathlib signature issues (joinpath vararg, read_text/write_text).
- **Spec restructuring**: 12 legacy specs archived. spec-codex.md renamed to spec-agent.md. spec/index.md reorganized into categorized tables. 6 previously unlinked specs added. spec-opaque-type.md (`@extern class` type contract) created.
- **Guide section added**: 5 guide pages (EAST, emitter, type system, runtime, extern/FFI) added to docs/guide/. Guide section positioned between Tutorial and Specification.
- **Tutorial expansion**: Exception handling, Python differences, module reference (argparse/glob/re/enum/timeit), and samples pages added. Reading order restructured.
- **AGENTS.md split**: Separated into planner / coder role-specific specs. Minimized bootstrap entry.

## 2026-03-27

- **C++ emitter spec compliance (S1-S15)**: Fail-fast, mapping.json unification, container reference wrappers (`Object<list<T>>` etc.), implicit_promotions, is_entry/main_guard_body, @property support, shared runtime path resolution.
- **Traits (pure interface, multiple implementation)**: `@trait` / `@implements` decorators for pure interfaces. C++ uses virtual inheritance + `Object<T>` converting constructor; Go uses interface generation. Trait isinstance is compile-time only (no runtime info needed).
- **isinstance narrowing**: Automatic type environment update after `if isinstance(x, T):` in the resolve stage. Supports if/elif, early return guard (`if not isinstance: return`), ternary isinstance (`y = x if isinstance(x, T) else None`), and `and`-chained conditions.
- **Ternary Optional type inference**: `expr if cond else None` → `Optional[T]`, different types → `UnionType` inferred at resolve.
- **pytra.std.json parser support**: PEP 695 recursive type alias (`type JsonVal = ...`) and Union forward reference now parseable. Golden files regenerated.
- **POD isinstance**: `isinstance(x, int16)` etc. implemented as exact type match. Specified in spec-type_id.md §4.2.
- **Link input completeness check**: Unresolved imports in link-input are reported as fail-closed errors. Type stubs for unparseable modules.
- **ClosureDef lowering**: Nested FunctionDef lowered to ClosureDef in EAST3 with capture analysis (readonly/mutable).
- **Lowering profile design**: Language capability declarations (tuple_unpack_style, container_covariance, with_style, etc. — 16 items) added to spec-language-profile.md §7. CommonRenderer design in §8.
- **Tutorial additions**: Union types and isinstance narrowing, Traits tutorial pages added. English translations included.

## 2026-03-26

- **Pipeline redesign completed**: All 6 stages of the pipeline (`parse → resolve → compile → optimize → link → emit`) via `pytra-cli2` are fully operational. toolchain2 is a completely independent implementation with no dependency on toolchain.
- **Go backend migrated to new pipeline**: Go emitter + runtime implemented on the new pipeline. 18/18 samples emit success. Legacy Go emitter/runtime removed.
- **C++ emitter new implementation**: New pipeline C++ emitter implemented in `toolchain2/emit/cpp/`. fixture 132/132, sample 18/18 emit success.
- **CodeEmitter base class**: runtime_call mapping via `mapping.json` shared across all emitters. Hardcoding removed.
- **Spec conformance (Codex-review)**: 20+ spec violations fixed across resolve/parser/validator/linker/emitter.
- **spec-east1.md / spec-east2.md**: EAST1 (type-unresolved) and EAST2 (type-determined) output contracts formally defined.
- **spec-builtin-functions.md**: Built-in function declaration spec. POD/Obj type classification, dunder delegation, extern_fn/extern_var/extern_class/extern_method.
- **spec-runtime-mapping.md**: mapping.json format spec. implicit_promotions table.
- **Integer promotion**: Numeric promotion casts conforming to C++ usual arithmetic conversion inserted at resolve.
- **bytearray support**: `pytra/utils/png.py` / `gif.py` rewritten from `list[int]` to `bytearray`. Maps to `[]byte` in Go.

## 2026-03-25

- **All P0 tasks completed**: All stages (parse/resolve/compile/optimize/link/emit) match golden file tests.
- **test/ directory reorganization**: Organized into 5 categories: fixture/sample/include/pytra/selfhost.
- **Automatic golden file regeneration**: `tools/regenerate_golden.py` for batch regeneration of all golden files.
- **Go emitter**: Implemented as the reference emitter. fixture 132/132, sample 18/18 emit success.
- **Go runtime + parity**: 18/18 samples pass `go run` + stdout match. Go is 63x faster than Python.
- **Go runtime decomposition**: Split `pytra_runtime.go` monolith into `built_in/` + `std/` + `utils/`.

## 2026-03-24

- **Pipeline redesign started**: Designed 5-stage pipeline (parse/resolve/compile/optimize/emit), later expanded to 6 stages with link.
- **toolchain2/ created**: New pipeline implementation independent of existing toolchain/. Selfhost-ready (no Any/object, pytra.std only).
- **pytra-cli2**: New CLI with -parse/-resolve/-compile/-optimize/-link/-emit/-build subcommands.
- **EAST1 golden files**: Golden files stripped (type info removed) conforming to spec-east1. 150 files.
- **Built-in function declarations**: `src/include/py/pytra/built_in/builtins.py` + `containers.py`. v2 extern (extern_fn/extern_var/extern_class/extern_method).
- **stdlib declarations**: v2 extern declarations for math/time/glob/os/sys etc. in `src/include/py/pytra/std/`.
