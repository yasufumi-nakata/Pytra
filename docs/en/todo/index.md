## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

1. [ ] [ID: P4-CROSSRUNTIME-PYRUNTIME-RESIDUAL-CALLER-SHRINK-01] Inventory the remaining `py_runtime` callers in native compiler wrappers, generated C++ runtime code, and Rust/C# runtime builtins, then realign the residual object-bridge and shared type_id seams that still block further `py_runtime.h` shrink. Context: [p4-crossruntime-pyruntime-residual-caller-shrink.md](../plans/p4-crossruntime-pyruntime-residual-caller-shrink.md)
   Progress memo: Through `S2-02`, the non-emitter residual caller inventory is fixed into six buckets, the native-wrapper residual is locked with representative smoke/source guards, and the generated C++ residuals are re-classified into `must remain` and `re-delegatable`.
2. [ ] [ID: P5-BACKEND-FEATURE-PARITY-CONTRACT-01] Fix a shared feature contract, backend support-state taxonomy, and fail-closed policy for syntax / builtins / `pytra.std.*` so C++ alone no longer defines completion. Context: [p5-backend-feature-parity-contract.md](../plans/p5-backend-feature-parity-contract.md)
3. [ ] [ID: P6-BACKEND-CONFORMANCE-SUITE-01] Design a shared conformance suite that validates parse / lowering / emit / runtime parity from the same feature fixtures across multiple backends. Context: [p6-backend-conformance-suite.md](../plans/p6-backend-conformance-suite.md)
4. [ ] [ID: P7-BACKEND-PARITY-ROLLOUT-MATRIX-01] Define the feature × backend support matrix, rollout tiers, and review checklist needed to institutionalize backend parity in docs and tooling. Context: [p7-backend-parity-rollout-and-matrix.md](../plans/p7-backend-parity-rollout-and-matrix.md)
