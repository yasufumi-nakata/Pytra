## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks


### P5: Full rollout of nominal ADT as a language feature

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p5-nominal-adt-language-rollout.md](../plans/p5-nominal-adt-language-rollout.md)

1. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01] Perform the full rollout of nominal ADT as a language feature.
2. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-01] Inventory candidate language-surface designs for nominal ADT declarations, constructors, variant access, and `match`, then choose a selfhost-safe staged rollout.
   - Progress memo: canonical v1 reuses existing `class` / `@dataclass` / `isinstance`, and `match` is fixed as a later statement-first stage.
3. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-02] Fix the boundary between type-system groundwork, narrowing groundwork, and full language-surface rollout so this plan does not conflict with `P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01`.
4. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S2-01] Extend `spec-east`, `spec-user`, and `spec-dev` with nominal-ADT declarations, pattern nodes, `match` nodes, and diagnostics contracts.
   - Progress memo: added the Stage-A `@sealed` family / top-level variant surface, the Stage-B `Match`/pattern schema, and fail-closed diagnostics contracts to the specs.
5. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S2-02] Fix the policy and error categories for exhaustiveness checks, duplicate patterns, and unreachable branches.
   - Progress memo: the specs now require exhaustive `Match` over closed families and stop duplicate/unreachable branches with `semantic_conflict`.
6. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S3-01] Update the frontend and selfhost parser so representative nominal-ADT syntax is accepted.
   - Progress memo: the selfhost parser now accepts the representative `@sealed` family, same-module variant, mandatory `@dataclass` payload variant, and `ClassDef.meta.nominal_adt_v1` cases end-to-end.
7. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S3-02] Introduce ADT constructors, variant tests, variant projections, and `match` lowering into EAST/EAST3.
   - Progress memo: representative coverage now fixes constructor / family-variant test / variant-typed projection plus `Match` as `NominalAdtMatch`, `VariantPattern` as `NominalAdtVariantPattern`, and typed payload-bind metadata.
8. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S4-01] Confirm through representative tests that the built-in `JsonValue` lane and user-defined nominal-ADT lane share the same IR category.
   - Progress memo: representative tests now fix both the `JsonValue` receiver lane and the user-defined nominal ADT `Match` subject lane to `category=nominal_adt`.
9. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S4-02] Implement the minimum representative backend support, starting with C++, for constructors, variant checks, destructuring, and `match`, and forbid silent fallbacks.
   - Progress memo: the C++ backend now handles constructor / projection / `isinstance` through the existing class lane, lowers `NominalAdtMatch` into `if / else if`, and fail-closes plain `Match`.
10. [x] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S5-01] Define rollout order and fail-closed policy for other backends, and fix diagnostics for unsupported targets.
   - Progress memo: The rollout order is fixed as `Rust/C#/Go/Java/Kotlin/Scala/Swift/Nim` -> `JS/TS` -> `Lua/Ruby/PHP`; unsupported targets now fail close either through the Rust/C# lane-level `unsupported_syntax` guard or, for the remaining targets, backend-local `unsupported stmt kind: Match` diagnostics, and Nim's old comment fallback is gone.
   - Progress memo: as the first slice, Rust and C# now fail closed with `unsupported_syntax` for representative nominal ADT v1 `declaration`, `Match`, and `NominalAdtProjection` lanes.
11. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S5-02] Update selfhost / docs / archive / migration notes and close the rollout as a formal language feature.
