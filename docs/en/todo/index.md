## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

### P2: Move compiler boundaries to typed carriers and retreat internal object-carrier / `make_object` usage

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p2-compiler-typed-boundary.md](../plans/p2-compiler-typed-boundary.md)

1. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01] Move compiler boundaries to typed carriers and retreat internal object-carrier / `make_object` usage.
2. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S1-01] Inventory remaining `dict[str, object]`, `list[object]`, `make_object`, and `py_to` usage across `transpile_cli`, `backend_registry_static`, selfhost parser paths, and generated compiler runtime, then classify each usage as `compiler_internal`, `json_adapter`, `extern_hook`, or `legacy_bridge`.
3. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S1-02] Lock the typed-boundary contract and non-goals so they stay consistent with `spec-dev`, `spec-runtime`, and `spec-boxing`.
4. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S2-01] Define typed carrier specs for compiler root payloads: EAST document, backend spec, layer options, and emit request/result.
5. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S2-02] Introduce typed carriers and thin legacy adapters in the Python source of truth.
6. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S2-03] Introduce typed carrier mirrors or typed wrapper APIs in the C++ selfhost/native compiler interfaces and reduce raw `dict<str, object>` exchange.
7. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-01] Move selfhost parser / EAST builder node construction onto typed constructors / builder helpers and gradually retire direct `dict<str, object>{{...}}` assembly.
8. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] Retreat remaining `make_object` usage in generated compiler / selfhost runtime down to serialization/export seams only.
9. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-A] Redefine the `S3-02` completion criteria and compress TODO/plan progress notes to cluster-level summaries.
10. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-B] Split the postfix/suffix parser cluster out of `core.py` and move `call` / `attr` / `subscript` parsing into dedicated modules.
11. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-C] Split the call-annotation cluster out of `core.py` and move `named-call` / `attr-call` / `callee-call` handling into dedicated modules.
12. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-D] Finish the remaining `call-arg` / `suffix tail` / `subscript tail` helper extraction in bundles of 5-10 clusters instead of one-helper commits.
13. [x] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-E] Rebaseline generated/selfhost residual guards and export seams, retreat `make_object` down to serialization/export seams only, and close `S3-02`.
14. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-01] Separate JSON, extern/hooks, and intentionally dynamic carriers from the compiler typed model behind `JsonValue` or explicit adapters.
15. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-02] Label every remaining `make_object` / `py_to` / `obj_to_*` usage and add guards that reject uncategorized reintroduction.
16. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S5-01] Refresh selfhost build/diff/prepare/bridge regressions and lock non-regression after the typed-boundary changes.
17. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S5-02] Update docs / TODO / archive and record whether each remaining `make_object` usage is `user boundary only` or `explicit adapter only`.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S1-02] `S1-S2` classified object-carrier usage, fixed typed-boundary non-goals, locked typed-carrier field contracts, and moved host/static/native wrappers onto thin legacy-adapter surfaces.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-01] Checked-in node construction is now mostly on `_sh_make_*` builder helpers; module root, imports, expr/stmt nodes, comprehensions, f-strings, trivia, and span carriers are guarded on the source-of-truth side.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] The host/static/native typed export seam is now centered on `typed_boundary.py`, and the selfhost entrypoint also routes through the direct typed path. Version gates and entrypoint contract tests guard against regressions.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] Generated/selfhost residual guards now cover module-root, import, expr, stmt, literal, comprehension, and f-string lanes, while the source-of-truth side fail-fast checks raw inline `kind` and open-coded dict regressions.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] Helper extraction around `call` / `attr` / `subscript` / `call-arg` has advanced substantially, but `core.py` and `test_east_core.py` became too large and one-helper commits became too fine-grained for the actual progress made.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] From this point on, `S3-02` proceeds in cluster units `S3-02-B` through `S3-02-E`; TODO keeps only cluster-level summaries, and fine-grained helper history stays in the plan decision log and git history.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-B] The postfix/suffix parser cluster now lives in `core_expr_call_suffix.py` and `core_expr_attr_subscript_suffix.py`, and `core.py` has been reduced toward mixin imports plus postfix-dispatch orchestration.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-C] The `call_expr` / `callee_call` / `named-call` / `attr-call` annotation entrypoints now live in `core_expr_call_annotation.py`. `core.py` is reduced to shared helpers and lower-level apply logic, and the remaining fine-grained helper extraction is tracked under `S3-02-D`.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-D] `call-arg` now lives in `core_expr_call_args.py`, `call suffix` in `core_expr_call_suffix.py`, and `attr/subscript suffix` in `core_expr_attr_subscript_suffix.py`; the remaining helper extraction was also regrouped into bundle-sized batches.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-E] Generated selfhost-core residual `make_object` guards now separate `export_seam` from `parser_residual`, and further split parser residuals into `expr_parser`, `stmt_parser`, and `lookup` buckets. Tests now also fix that the bucket union matches `parser_residual` and stays disjoint from `export_seam`.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02-E] The source-of-truth compiler lane and native wrapper are now free of `make_object` outside export seams, and generated selfhost-core usage is rebaselined into `export_seam=to_payload` plus explicit `parser_residual` guards, so `S3-02` is closed and the remaining labeling work moves to `S4-02`.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-01] Contract tests now pin the current dynamic-carrier seams to `JsonValue` raw carriers, extern-marked stdlib surfaces, the `typed_boundary.py` runtime-hook seam, and compiler-root JSON loading.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-01] `typed_boundary.py` now routes `runtime_hook` through `RuntimeHookAdapter`, so typed specs no longer hold raw hook callables directly and instead use explicit export/apply seams.
- Progress memo: [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-01] Native compiler-root JSON loading is now funneled through `_unwrap_compiler_root_json_doc()` / `_coerce_compiler_root_json_doc()`, keeping raw `JsonObj` unwrapping inside named adapters.

10. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S5-01] Add representative unit/selfhost regressions so contract violations are reproducible as expected failures.
11. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S5-02] Update docs / TODO / archive / migration notes so validator updates become mandatory whenever node/meta contracts change.

3. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-02] Inventory current gates and blind spots across `build_selfhost`, `stage2`, `verify_selfhost_end_to_end`, and multi-language selfhost flows, then fix the classification policy for known blocks and regressions in the decision log.
4. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-01] Define a canonical source of truth for backend capability, runtime copy, option schema, and writer metadata, and move both host and static registries to derive from it.

2. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-01] Inventory candidate language-surface designs for nominal ADT declarations, constructors, variant access, and `match`, then choose a selfhost-safe staged rollout.
3. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-02] Fix the boundary between type-system groundwork, narrowing groundwork, and full language-surface rollout so this plan does not conflict with `P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01`.
