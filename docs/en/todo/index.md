## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

1. [ ] [ID: P1-RELATIVE-IMPORT-ALIAS-HARDENING-01] Lock the current support for aliased relative imports with representative regressions and spec/doc contracts.
   Context: [docs/ja/plans/p1-relative-import-alias-hardening.md](../../ja/plans/p1-relative-import-alias-hardening.md)
   Progress memo: Lock sibling / parent aliased relative `from-import` across import graph, CLI, C++ smoke, and support docs.

### P2: Relative-import backend coverage contract

Context: [p2-relative-import-backend-coverage.md](../plans/p2-relative-import-backend-coverage.md)

1. [ ] [ID: P2-RELATIVE-IMPORT-BACKEND-COVERAGE-01] Lock the current relative-import verification coverage by backend and prepare the baseline for later non-C++ rollout work.
2. [x] [ID: P2-RELATIVE-IMPORT-BACKEND-COVERAGE-01-S1-01] Locked the live plan / TODO and the representative backend coverage taxonomy.
3. [x] [ID: P2-RELATIVE-IMPORT-BACKEND-COVERAGE-01-S2-01] Added the backend coverage inventory, checker, and unit tests.
4. [ ] [ID: P2-RELATIVE-IMPORT-BACKEND-COVERAGE-01-S2-02] Sync docs / support-matrix handoff wording to the current coverage baseline.

- Progress note: The current relative-import coverage is now fixed as `cpp=build_run_locked` while non-C++ backends remain `not_locked`, through an inventory and checker.
