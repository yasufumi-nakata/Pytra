## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

1. [ ] [ID: P1-IR-CORE-IMPORT-SURFACE-01] Push `toolchain.ir.core` toward an external thin facade and shrink internal split-module dependence on it as an import hub.
   Context: [docs/ja/plans/p1-ir-core-import-surface-pruning.md](../../ja/plans/p1-ir-core-import-surface-pruning.md)
- Progress memo: [ID: P1-IR-CORE-IMPORT-SURFACE-01-S1-02] facade exports are fixed as `CORE_PUBLIC_FACADE_EXPORTS` and `CORE_BRIDGE_COMPAT_EXPORTS`, and new `toolchain.ir.core` dependencies from `internal_split_module` are now forbidden by policy.
- Progress memo: [ID: P1-IR-CORE-IMPORT-SURFACE-01-S2-01] representative lanes moved `core_entrypoints`, `core_string_semantics`, `core_expr_primary`, `core_expr_lowered`, and `core_expr_call_args` off the `toolchain.ir.core` import hub onto dedicated modules.
- Progress memo: [ID: P1-IR-CORE-IMPORT-SURFACE-01-S2-02] helper and bridge lanes now source `INT_TYPES/FLOAT_TYPES` from `core_numeric_types`, removing `toolchain.ir.core` imports from `east2_to_human_repr` and `east_parts.__init__`.
- Progress memo: [ID: P1-IR-CORE-IMPORT-SURFACE-01-S2-01] `core_stmt_parser` and `core_module_parser` now use dedicated `*_parser_support` imports, so direct `from toolchain.ir.core import (...)` usage under `src/toolchain/ir` is gone.
