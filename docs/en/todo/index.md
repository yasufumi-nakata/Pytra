## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

### P5: py_runtime.h Shrink

#### P5-1: Remove py_is_type Dead Code

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p5-cpp-py-is-type-dead-code-remove.md](../../ja/plans/p5-cpp-py-is-type-dead-code-remove.md)

1. [x] [ID: P5-CPP-PY-IS-TYPE-DEAD-CODE-REMOVE-01] Remove `py_is_dict` / `py_is_list` / `py_is_set` / `py_is_str` / `py_is_bool` / `py_is_int` / `py_is_float` from `py_runtime.h`. The emitter has already migrated to the `PYTRA_TID_*` + `py_runtime_value_isinstance` system; these functions are dead code.
- Progress: Completed. 7 functions removed, 1 test fixed. fixture/sample pass, selfhost mismatches=0.

#### P5-2: FloorDiv / Mod EAST3 IR Node

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p5-east3-floordiv-mod-node.md](../../ja/plans/p5-east3-floordiv-mod-node.md)

2. [x] [ID: P5-EAST3-FLOORDIV-MOD-NODE-01] Convert `py_floordiv` / `py_mod` to C++ inline emit via EAST3 IR nodes and remove from `py_runtime.h`. Lays the groundwork for each language backend to generate floor-division and modulo natively.
- Progress: Completed. py_div/floordiv/mod moved to scalar_ops.h. py_div inlined for arithmetic types, fallback kept for object boundary. mismatches=0. cpp 0.581.1.

### P6: py_runtime.h Shrink / Multi-language Support

#### P6-1: Fix C++ Emitter List-Mutation IR Bypass

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p6-cpp-list-mut-ir-bypass-fix.md](../../ja/plans/p6-cpp-list-mut-ir-bypass-fix.md)

1. [x] [ID: P6-CPP-LIST-MUT-IR-BYPASS-FIX-01] Route all `py_list_*_mut()` direct-emit paths in `cpp_emitter.py` through IR nodes (ListAppend, etc.) and remove the 6 functions from `py_runtime.h`.
- Progress: Completed. 6 functions moved to list_ops.h; emitter updated to direct method calls (.append() etc.); generated C++ files updated. mismatches=0. cpp 0.581.2.

#### P6-2: py_len / py_slice EAST3 IR Nodes

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p6-east3-len-slice-node.md](../../ja/plans/p6-east3-len-slice-node.md)

2. [x] [ID: P6-EAST3-LEN-SLICE-NODE-01] Add EAST3 IR nodes for `py_len` / `py_slice`, update the C++ emitter to generate inline expressions, and remove both from `py_runtime.h`.
- Progress: Completed. py_len moved to base_ops.h; py_slice str variant renamed to py_str_slice (same file); list variants removed (emitter emits py_list_slice_copy directly). truthy_len_expr override generates .empty() check. selfhost mismatches=0. cpp 0.581.3.
