## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks
### P0: fix the C++ backend input validator drift against the object-tree iterator API

- [ ] [ID: P0-CPP-BACKEND-INPUT-VALIDATOR-ITERTREE-01] Bring `validate_cpp_backend_input_doc()` in sync with the `_iter_object_tree()` API that now yields `parent_key`, so typed-boundary / backend-input validation no longer stops on a tuple-unpack error.
  - Context: [docs/en/plans/p0-cpp-backend-input-validator-itertree.md](../plans/p0-cpp-backend-input-validator-itertree.md)
- [ ] [ID: P0-CPP-BACKEND-INPUT-VALIDATOR-ITERTREE-01-S1-01] Add a focused regression around a minimal raw EAST3 module and lock the current C++ backend-input crash surface in fail-fast form.
- [ ] [ID: P0-CPP-BACKEND-INPUT-VALIDATOR-ITERTREE-01-S2-01] Switch `validate_cpp_backend_input_doc()` to the `parent_key`-aware object-tree iteration while preserving the existing `ForCore` metadata guards, then bring the targeted link tests back to green.
- [ ] [ID: P0-CPP-BACKEND-INPUT-VALIDATOR-ITERTREE-01-S3-01] Sync TODO / plan / decision log and lock the close condition.
