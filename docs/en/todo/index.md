## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details (decisions and verification logs) must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file (keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed).
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` (or its child `ID`).
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` (or `/tmp` only when necessary), and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

### P2: Move compiler boundaries to typed carriers and retreat internal object-carrier / `make_object` usage

5. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S2-02] Introduce typed carriers and thin legacy adapters in the Python source of truth.
6. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S2-03] Introduce typed carrier mirrors or typed wrapper APIs in the C++ selfhost/native compiler interfaces and reduce raw `dict<str, object>` exchange.
7. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-01] Move selfhost parser / EAST builder node construction onto typed constructors / builder helpers and gradually retire direct `dict<str, object>{{...}}` assembly.

12. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S5-02] Update docs / TODO / archive and record whether each remaining `make_object` usage is `user boundary only` or `explicit adapter only`.

2. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S1-01] Inventory the current `check_east_stage_boundary`, `validate_raw_east3_doc`, and backend-entry guards, then classify blind spots that still go unchecked (`node shape`, `type_expr` / `resolved_type`, `source_span`, helper metadata).
3. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S1-02] Fix the responsibility boundary between schema validators, invariant validators, and backend-input validators so this plan does not overlap with `P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01` or `P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01`.

5. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S2-02] Fix the consistency rules and fail-closed policy for `type_expr` / `resolved_type` mirrors, `dispatch_mode`, `source_span`, and helper metadata.
6. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S3-01] Add central validator primitives around `toolchain/link/program_validator.py` and expand raw EAST3 / linked-output checks from coarse validation into node/meta invariant checks.
7. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S3-02] Add pre/post validation hooks to representative passes, lowering entrypoints, and linker entrypoints so malformed nodes stop propagating.

11. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S5-02] Refresh docs / TODO / archive / migration notes and fix the rule that validator updates are mandatory when new nodes/meta are introduced.

### P4: Canonicalize backend-registry metadata and strengthen selfhost parity gates

2. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-01] Inventory duplicated surfaces across `backend_registry.py` and `backend_registry_static.py` (backend spec, runtime copy, writer rules, option schema, direct-route behavior), then classify each difference as intentional or drift-prone.
3. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S1-02] Inventory current gates and blind spots across `build_selfhost`, stage2, direct e2e verification, and multilang selfhost tools, then fix the known-block vs regression classification policy in the decision log.
4. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-01] Define the canonical source of truth for backend capability, runtime-copy rules, option schema, and writer metadata so both host and static registries can be derived from it.
5. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S2-02] Fix the boundaries where intentional differences are allowed (for example host-only lazy imports or selfhost-only direct routes) together with their diagnostic contracts.
6. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-01] Move host/static registries toward shared metadata, a generator, or equivalent adapters and retire avoidable handwritten duplication.
7. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-02] Add a registry-drift guard or diff test so one-sided backend-surface updates fail fast.
8. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S4-01] Reorganize representative stage1 / stage2 / direct e2e / multilang selfhost parity suites so they report a stable shared summary and failure taxonomy.

10. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S5-01] Refresh docs / plan reports / archive so backend readiness, known blocks, and gate execution flow remain traceable.
11. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S5-02] Verify that representative internal changes are checked through equivalent contracts on both host and selfhost lanes, then fix reintroduction guards.

2. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-01] Inventory candidate language surfaces for nominal ADT declarations, constructors, variant access, and `match`, then decide on a selfhost-safe staged introduction path.
3. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-02] Fix the boundary between type-system base work, narrowing-base work, and full language-feature work so this plan does not overlap with `P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01`.
