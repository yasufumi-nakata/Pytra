## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details such as decisions and verification logs must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file, but keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` or one of its child IDs.
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` or `/tmp` only when necessary, and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

- [ ] [ID: P1-NONCPP-RUNTIME-LAYOUT-ROLLOUT-REMAINING-01] Roll the `go/java/kotlin/scala/swift/nim/js/ts/lua/ruby/php` runtimes onto the same `generated/native` ownership model as P0 (context: [p1-noncpp-runtime-layout-rollout-remaining.md](../plans/p1-noncpp-runtime-layout-rollout-remaining.md)). Progress: `S1-01` locked the mapping table and hook/path baseline checker, `S1-02` fixed current/target file inventory, module buckets, and the canonical compare-baseline coverage rule (`generated ∪ blocked = built_in/std/utils baseline`, while compat/native overlap remains allowed), `S2-01` cut the Wave A (`go/java/kotlin/scala/swift/nim`) runtime tree / hook / guard / smoke path baseline over to `generated/native`, `S2-02` cleared the Java `std/json` stale lane, added representative `Try/finally` lowering for Nim `utils/*_helper`, and restored the full Wave A regeneration check, `S2-03` contractized the Wave A native residuals before removing Java `native/std/{math_impl,time_impl}` by absorbing them into the generated lane, `S3-01` was completed in two bundles (`js/ts`, then `lua/ruby/php`) so the entire Wave B runtime tree / shim / package-export baseline now uses `generated/native`, with PHP public output paths normalized to `pytra/utils/*`, the first `S3-02` bundle confirmed live regeneration for `lua/ruby/php` `utils/png,gif` together with a fully green `audit_image_runtime_sot`, and the next bundle taught the Lua emitter to ignore compile-time `pytra.std` decorator imports so `gen_runtime_from_manifest.py --targets js,ts,lua,ruby,php --check` is green again.
- [ ] [ID: P5-BACKEND-PARITY-SECONDARY-ROLLOUT-01] Fill the remaining unsupported support-matrix cells for the secondary tier (`go/java/kt/scala/swift/nim`) as a live implementation rollout task (context: [p5-backend-parity-secondary-rollout.md](../plans/p5-backend-parity-secondary-rollout.md))
- [ ] [ID: P6-BACKEND-PARITY-LONGTAIL-ROLLOUT-01] Fill the remaining unsupported support-matrix cells for the long-tail tier (`js/ts/lua/rb/php`) as a live implementation rollout task (context: [p6-backend-parity-longtail-rollout.md](../plans/p6-backend-parity-longtail-rollout.md))
