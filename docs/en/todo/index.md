## Context Operation Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- To override priority, issue chat instructions in the format of `docs/ja/plans/instruction-template.md`; do not use `todo2.md`.
- The active target is fixed to the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, and the first one from the top when priorities are equal); do not move to lower priorities unless there is an explicit override instruction.
- If even one `P0` remains unfinished, do not start `P1` or lower.
- Before starting, check `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress memos and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memos in `docs/ja/todo/index.md` to a one-line summary only; details (decisions and verification logs) must be recorded in the `Decision log` of the context file (`docs/ja/plans/*.md`).
- If one `ID` is too large, you may split it into child tasks in `-S1` / `-S2` format in the context file (keep the parent checkbox open until the parent `ID` is completed).
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruptions, do not start a different `ID` until you complete the same `ID` or revert the diff.
- When updating `docs/ja/todo/index.md` or `docs/ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and verify that each progress `ID` added in the diff matches the highest-priority unfinished `ID` (or its child `ID`).
- Append in-progress decisions to the context file `Decision log`.
- For temporary output, use existing `out/` (or `/tmp` only when necessary), and do not add new temporary folders under the repository root.

## Notes

- This file keeps unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs/ja/todo/archive/index.md` keeps only the index, and the history body is stored by date in `docs/ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.

## Unfinished Tasks

### P1: Structure EAST type representation and lift union / nominal ADT / narrowing out of string processing

Context: [docs/ja/plans/p1-east-typeexpr-strengthening.md](../plans/p1-east-typeexpr-strengthening.md)

1. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01] Structure EAST type representation and lift union / nominal ADT / narrowing out of string processing.
2. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S1-01] Inventory `split_union` / `normalize_type_name` / `resolved_type` string dependencies across frontend, lowering, optimizer, and backends, then classify them into `optional`, `dynamic union`, `nominal ADT`, and `generic container` usage.
3. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S1-02] Lock the end state, non-goals, and migration order in the decision log so they remain consistent with archived `EAST123` and `JsonValue` contracts.
4. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S2-01] Extend `spec-east` / `spec-dev` with `TypeExpr` schema, the three-way union classification, and the authority relationship between `type_expr` and `resolved_type`.
5. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S2-02] Fix the IR contract that treats `JsonValue` as a nominal closed ADT rather than a generic union, including decode/narrowing responsibility and backend fail-closed rules.
6. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S3-01] Update frontend type-annotation parsing to build `TypeExpr` from `int | bool`, `T | None`, and nested generic unions.
7. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S3-02] Keep a migration `resolved_type` string mirror temporarily, but add validators and mismatch guards that treat `type_expr` as the source of truth.
8. [x] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S4-01] In `EAST2 -> EAST3`, distinguish optionals, dynamic unions, and nominal ADTs, and introduce instructions or metadata for narrowing / variant checks / decode helpers.
9. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S4-02] Connect a representative `JsonValue` narrowing path (`as_obj/as_arr/as_int/...` or equivalent decode operations) through IR-first lowering rather than backend-local special cases.
10. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S5-01] Use C++ as the first target and replace at least part of the current `general union -> object` path with fail-closed behavior or structured lowering.
11. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S5-02] Audit other backends for `String/object` union fallbacks and align unsupported `TypeExpr` unions to explicit errors or guarded compatibility paths.
12. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S6-01] Put a representative `JsonValue` lane on top of the new `TypeExpr` / nominal-ADT contract and verify that future runtime work can proceed IR-contract-first.
13. [ ] [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S6-02] Refresh selfhost / unit / docs / archive and add guards against the reintroduction of stringly-typed union debt.
- Progress memo: [ID: P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01-S4-02] `S4-01` taught the frontend to stamp JSON decode helpers with `json.*` semantic tags and taught lowering to attach `type_expr_summary_v1` / `json_decode_v1`. Next is moving a representative `JsonValue` narrowing path onto a dedicated IR category.

8. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S3-02] Retreat remaining `make_object` usage in generated compiler / selfhost runtime down to serialization/export seams only.
9. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S4-01] Separate JSON, extern/hooks, and other intentionally dynamic carriers from the compiler typed model behind `JsonValue` or explicit adapters.

12. [ ] [ID: P2-COMPILER-TYPED-BOUNDARY-01-S5-02] Update docs / TODO / archive and record whether each remaining `make_object` usage is `user boundary only` or `explicit adapter only`.

2. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S1-01] Inventory the current `check_east_stage_boundary`, `validate_raw_east3_doc`, and backend-entry guards, then classify blind spots that still go unchecked (`node shape`, `type_expr` / `resolved_type`, `source_span`, helper metadata).

7. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S3-02] Add pre/post validation hooks to representative passes, lowering entrypoints, and linker entrypoints so malformed nodes stop propagating.
8. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S4-01] Run compiler-contract validators at representative backend entrypoints (first C++) and replace backend-local crashes or silent fallback with structured diagnostics.
9. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S4-02] Extend `tools/check_east_stage_boundary.py` or its successor guard so it can detect stage semantic-contract drift too.
10. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S5-01] Add representative unit/selfhost regressions so contract violations are reproducible as expected failures.
11. [ ] [ID: P3-COMPILER-CONTRACT-HARDENING-01-S5-02] Refresh docs / TODO / archive / migration notes and fix the rule that validator updates are mandatory when new nodes/meta are introduced.

6. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-01] Move host/static registries toward shared metadata, a generator, or equivalent adapters and retire avoidable handwritten duplication.
7. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S3-02] Add a registry-drift guard or diff test so one-sided backend-surface updates fail fast.
8. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S4-01] Reorganize representative stage1 / stage2 / direct e2e / multilang selfhost parity suites so they report a stable shared summary and failure taxonomy.

11. [ ] [ID: P4-BACKEND-REGISTRY-SELFHOST-PARITY-01-S5-02] Verify that representative internal changes are checked through equivalent contracts on both host and selfhost lanes, then fix reintroduction guards.

3. [ ] [ID: P5-NOMINAL-ADT-ROLLOUT-01-S1-02] Fix the boundary between type-system base work, narrowing-base work, and full language-feature work so this plan does not overlap with `P1-EAST-TYPEEXPR-01`.
