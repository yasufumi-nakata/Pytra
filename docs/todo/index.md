## Context Rules

- Every task must include an `ID` and a context file (`docs-ja/plans/*.md`).
- Priority overrides must be instructed in chat using `docs-ja/plans/instruction-template.md` format; do not use `todo2.md`.
- Default execution target is the highest-priority unfinished ID (smallest `P<number>`, first in order within same priority). Do not move to lower priority without explicit override.
- If any `P0` is unfinished, do not start `P1` or below.
- Before starting, confirm `Background` / `Out of scope` / `Acceptance criteria` in the context file.
- Progress notes and commit messages must include the same `ID` (example: `[ID: P0-XXX-01] ...`).
- Keep progress memo in `docs-ja/todo/index.md` to one line; detailed judgment/verification logs belong in the context file (`docs-ja/plans/*.md`) `Decision log`.
- If one `ID` is large, split into child tasks (`-S1`, `-S2`, ...) in the context file while keeping parent checkbox open until parent is done.
- If uncommitted changes remain due to interruption, do not start another `ID` until completing the same `ID` or reverting diffs.
- When updating `docs-ja/todo/index.md` / `docs-ja/plans/*.md`, run `python3 tools/check_todo_priority.py` and confirm new progress `ID` matches top unfinished `ID` (or its child).
- Append work-time decisions to the context file `Decision log`.

## Notes

- This file stores unfinished tasks only.
- Completed tasks are moved to history via `docs-ja/todo/archive/index.md`.
- `docs-ja/todo/archive/index.md` is index-only; history bodies are saved by date in `docs-ja/todo/archive/YYYYMMDD.md`.
