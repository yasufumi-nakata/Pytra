This file is a historical archive migrated from prior `docs/todo.md` states.
Completed items are kept for traceability. Active items were later moved to the current `docs/todo.md`.

## 2026-02-21 Completed: Pass-through Notation

1. [x] Specified and minimally implemented transpile-time pass-through notation (`# Pytra::cpp` / `# Pytra::pass`).

## Recent Notes

Historical notes preserved in this archive reported:
