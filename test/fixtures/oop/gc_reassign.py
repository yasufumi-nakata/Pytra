# This file contains test/implementation code for `test/fixtures/gc_reassign.py`.
# Verify that reassignment `a = b` destroys the object whose reference was dropped.
#
# NOTE: This test relies on deterministic destruction (__del__ called immediately
# when the last reference is dropped).  This is only valid for reference-counted
# languages (C++).  GC-based languages (PowerShell, Java, C#, Go, Julia, Dart,
# Kotlin, Swift) do NOT guarantee __del__ timing and should skip this test.
